Introduction
It was in the depths of a gray and chill Washington winter. On a side street not far from Dupont Circle,
in a brownstone filled with electric guitars and an eclectic collection of art, we gathered to remember the
man who had taught us how to analyze issues of war and defense. Two dozen of his former students,
now mostly in their fifties, drank toasts that February night in 2009 to Professor William W. Kaufmann,
who had died weeks earlier at age ninety. Bill, as everyone referred to him that night, had taught defense
analysis and strategic nuclear weapons policy at MIT for decades, and later at Harvard and the
Brookings Institution. Generations of civilian and military â  expertsâ had earned that title by passing
through his courses. Bill was also an advisor to six Secretaries of Defense, sitting in the â  front officeâ on
the E Ring of the Pentagon. He shuttled between Boston and Washington every week for decades.
Behind his back, some of us had referred to Professor Kaufmann as â  Yoda,â in part because of a
vague physical and stylistic resemblance, but chiefly because we thought of him as our Jedi master, the
man who understood the workings of the Force and tried to teach them to us. As an analyst and advisor,
Bill had been one of a handful of civilians who had created the framework of strategic nuclear war
doctrine in the late 1950s and early 1960s. They had walked the United States back from a nuclear
strategy that had called for the United States to go first in a nuclear war, to use all of its nuclear weapons
in one massive attack, and to destroy hundreds of cities in Europe and Asia. Bill and his colleagues had
probably prevented a global nuclear war and had made strategic arms control possible. Our conversation
that night, lubricated by the same martinis Bill used to drink with us, turned to the future. What could we
do to honor the memory of William W. Kaufmann and the other strategists of the second half of the
twentieth century? We could, someone suggested, continue their work, use what Bill had taught us, ask
the tough analytical questions about todayâ s strategy. Another at the table suggested that today is very
different from the 1950s, when nuclear weapons were being deployed without a thoughtful strategy;
strategies are well developed today.
But is it such a different time? In the first decade of the twenty-first century, the U.S. developed and
systematically deployed a new type of weapon, based on our new technologies, and we did so without a
thoughtful strategy. We created a new military command to conduct a new kind of high-tech war, without
public debate, media discussion, serious congressional oversight, academic analysis, or international
dialogue. Perhaps, then, we are at a time with some striking similarities to the 1950s. Perhaps, then, we
need to stimulate learned discussion and rigorous analysis about that new kind of weapon, that new kind
of war.
It is cyberspace and war in it about which I speak. On October 1, 2009, a general took charge of the
new U.S. Cyber Command, a military organization with the mission to use information technology and the
Internet as a weapon. Similar commands exist in Russia, China, and a score of other nations. These
military and intelligence organizations are preparing the cyber battlefield with things called â  logic bombsâ
and â  trapdoors,â placing virtual explosives in other countries in peacetime. Given the unique nature of
cyber war, there may be incentives to go first. The most likely targets are civilian in nature. The speed at
which thousands of targets can be hit, almost anywhere in the world, brings with it the prospect of highly
volatile crises. The force that prevented nuclear war, deterrence, does not work well in cyber war. The
entire phenomenon of cyber war is shrouded in such government secrecy that it makes the Cold War
look like a time of openness and transparency. The biggest secret in the world about cyber war may be
that at the very same time the U.S. prepares for offensive cyber war, it is continuing policies that make it
impossible to defend the nation effectively from cyber attack.
A nation that has invented the new technology, and the tactics to use it, may not be the victor, if its
own military is mired in the ways of the past, overcome by inertia, overconfident in the weapons they
have grown to love and consider supreme. The originator of the new offensive weaponry may be the
loser unless it has also figured out how to defend against the weapon it has shown to the rest of the
world. Thus, even though the American colonel Billy Mitchell was the first to understand the ability of
small aircraft to sink mighty battleships, it was the Japanese Imperial Navy that acted on that
Page 6
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
understanding, and came close to defeating the Americans in the Pacific in World War II. It was Britain
that first developed the tank, and a French colonel, Charles de Gaulle, who devised the tactics of rapid
attack with massed tanks, supported by air and artillery. Yet it was a recently defeated Germany that
perfected the tank in the 1930s and first employed de Gaulleâ s tactics, which later became known as
blitzkrieg. (As recently as 1990, and again in 2003, the U.S. military went to war with an updated version
of the seventy-year-old blitzkrieg tactic: fast movement of heavy tank units, supported by aircraft.)
Warmed by the camaraderie of my fellow ex-students, and by the martinis, I left the brownstone and
wandered out into that cold night, pondering this irony of history, and making a commitment to myself,
and to Bill, that I would try to stimulate open, public analysis and discussion of cyber-war strategy before
we stumbled into such a conflict. This book is the down payment on that commitment. I knew that I
needed a younger partner to join me in trying to understand the military and technological implications of
cyber war well enough to produce this book. Different generations think of cyberspace differently. For
me, looking at my sixtieth birthday in 2010, cyberspace is something that I saw gradually creep up
around me. It happened after I had already had a career dealing with nuclear weapons, in a bipolar
world. I became the first Special Advisor to the President for Cyber Security in 2001, but my views of
cyber war are colored by my background in nuclear strategy and espionage.
Rob Knake was thirty when he and I wrote this book. For his generation, the Internet and cyberspace
are as natural as air and water. Robâ s career has focused on homeland security and the transnational
threats of the twenty-first century. We have worked together at Harvardâ s Kennedy School of
Government, at Good Harbor Consulting, and on the Obama for America campaign. In 2009, Rob won
the prestigious International Affairs Fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations with an appointment
to study cyber war. We decided to use the first-person singular in the text because many times I will be
discussing my personal experiences with government, with the information-technology industry, and with
Washingtonâ s clans, but the research, writing, and concept development were a joint enterprise. We have
wandered around Washington and other parts of this country together in search of answers to the many
questions surrounding cyber war. Many people have helped us in that search, some of them wishing to
remain unnamed in this book because of their past or present associations. We had spent long hours
discussing, debating, and arguing until we found a synthesis of our views. Rob and I both agree that cyber
war is not some victimless, clean, new kind of war that we should embrace. Nor is it some kind of secret
weapon that we need to keep hidden from the daylight and from the public. For it is the public, the
civilian population of the United States and the publicly owned corporations that run our key national
systems, that are likely to suffer in a cyber war.
While it may appear to give America some sort of advantage, in fact cyber war places this country at
greater jeopardy than it does any other nation. Nor is this new kind of war a game or a figment of our
imaginations. Far from being an alternative to conventional war, cyber war may actually increase the
likelihood of the more traditional combat with explosives, bullets, and missiles. If we could put this genie
back in the bottle, we should, but we canâ t. Therefore, we need to embark on a complex series of tasks:
to understand what cyber war is, to learn how and why it works, to analyze its risks, to prepare for it,
and to think about how to control it.
This book is an attempt to begin to do some of that. It is not a technical book, not meant to be an
electrical engineerâ s guide to the details of cyber weapons. Nor is it designed to be a Washington wonkâ s
acronym-filled, jargon-encrusted political or legal exegesis. Finally, it is also definitely not a military
document and not written to be immediately translatable into Pentagonese. Therefore, some experts in
each of those fields may think the book simplistic in places where it discusses things they understand and
opaque in parts that stretch beyond their expertise. Overall, we have tried to strike a balance and to write
in an informal style that will be both clear and occasionally entertaining. Lest you take too much comfort
in those assurances, however, it is necessary in a book on this subject to discuss the technology, the
ways of Washington, as well as some military and intelligence themes. Likewise, it is impossible to avoid
entirely the use of acronyms and jargon, and therefore we include a glossary (starting in Backmatter).
I have been taught by senior national security officials for decades never to bring them a problem
without also suggesting a solution. This book certainly reveals some problems, but it also discusses
Page 7

potential solutions. Putting those or other defenses in place will take time, and until they are a reality, this
nation and others are running some new and serious risks to peace, to international stability, to internal
order, and to our national and individual economic well-being.
The authors wish to thank the many people who helped us with this book, most important the experts in
and out of governments who helped us on condition that they go unnamed. Pieter Zatko, John Mallery,
Chris Jordan, Ed Amoroso, Sami Saydjari, and Barnaby Page helped us understand some of the more
technical aspects of cyber security. Paul Kurtz served as a constant sounding board and helped shape
our thinking in innumerable ways. Ken Minihan, Mike McConnell, and Rich Wilhelm gave us added
insight from their decades in government and the private sector, Alan Paller, Greg Rattray, and Jim Lewis
gave their insights and latest thinking on this complex topic. We thank Janet Napolitano for taking time
out of her busy schedule to meet with us and for being willing to do so on the record. We also thank
Rand Beers for his wisdom. Will Howerton helped in a major way to get this book across the finish line.
He possesses a keen editorial eye and a gift for research. Will Bardenwerper also provided editorial
assistance.
Bev Roundtree, as she has been on so many projects over the decades, was the sine qua non.

CHAPTER ONE
TRIAL RUNS
A quarter-moon reflected on the slowly flowing Euphrates, a river along which nations have warred for
five thousand years. It was just after midnight, September 6, 2007, and a new kind of attack was about
to happen along the Euphrates, one that had begun in cyberspace. On the east side of the river,
seventy-five miles south into Syria from the Turkish border, up a dry wadi from the riverbank, a few low
lights cast shadows on the wadiâ s sandy walls. The shadows were from a large building under
construction. Many North Korean workers had left the construction site six hours earlier, queuing in
orderly lines to load onto buses for the drive to their nearby dormitory. For a construction site, the area
was unusually dark and unprotected, almost as if the builder wanted to avoid attracting attention.
Without warning, what seemed like small stars burst above the site, illuminating the area with a
blue-white clarity brighter than daylight. In less than a minute, although it seemed longer to the few
Syrians and Koreans still on the site, there was a blinding flash, then a concussive sound wave, and then
falling pieces of debris. If their hearing had not been temporarily destroyed by the explosions, those on
the ground nearby would then have heard a longer acoustic wash of military jet engines blanketing the
area. Had they been able to look beyond the flames that were now sweeping the construction site, or
above the illuminating flares that were still floating down on small parachutes, the Syrians and Koreans
might have seen F-15 Eagles and F-16 Falcons banking north, back toward Turkey. Perhaps they would
even have made out muted blue-and-white Star of David emblems on the wings of the Israeli Air Force
strike formation as it headed home, unscathed, leaving years of secret work near the wadi totally
destroyed.
Almost as unusual as the raid itself was the political silence that followed. The public affairs offices of
the Israeli government said nothing. Even more telling, Syria, which had been bombed, was silent.
Slowly, the story started to emerge in American and British media. Israel had bombed a complex in
eastern Syria, a facility being built by North Koreans. The facility was related to weapons of mass
destruction, the news accounts reported from unnamed sources. Israeli press censors allowed their nation
â s newspapers to quote American media accounts, but prohibited them from doing any reporting of their
own. It was, they said, a national security matter. Prompted by the media accounts, the Syrian
government belatedly admitted there had been an attack on their territory. Then they protested it,
somewhat meekly. Syrian President Assad asserted that what had been destroyed was â  an empty
building.â Curiously, only North Korea joined Damascus in expressing outrage at this surprise attack.
Media accounts differed slightly as to what had happened and why, but most quoted Israeli
government sources as saying that the facility had been a North Koreanâ designed nuclear weapons plant.
If that was true, North Korea had violated an agreement with the United States and other major powers
that it would stop selling nuclear weapons know-how. Worse, it meant that Syria, a nation on Israelâ s
border, a nation that had been negotiating with Israel through the Turks, had actually been trying secretly
to acquire nuclear weapons, something that even Saddam Hussein had stopped doing years before the
U.S. invasion of Iraq.
Soon, however, self-anointed experts were casting doubt on the â  Syria was making a nuclear bombâ
story.
Satellite pictures, taken by reconnaissance satellite, were revealed by Western media. Experts noted
that the site had little security around it before the bombing. Some contended that the building was not tall
enough to house a North Korean nuclear reactor. Others pointed to the lack of any other nuclear
infrastructure in Syria. They offered alternative theories. Maybe the building was related to Syriaâ s missile
program. Maybe Israel had just gotten it wrong and the building was relatively innocent, like Saddam
Husseinâ s alleged â  baby milk factoryâ of 1990 or Sudanâ s supposed aspirin plant of 1998, both
destroyed in U.S. strikes. Or maybe, said some commentators, Syria was not the real target. Maybe
Israel was sending a message to Iran, a message that the Jewish state could still successfully carry out
surprise air strikes, a message that a similar strike could occur on Iranian nuclear facilities unless Tehran
Page 9

stopped its nuclear development program.
Media reports quoting unnamed sources claimed various degrees of American involvement in the raid:
the Americans had discovered the site on satellite photography, or the Americans had overlooked the site
and the Israelis had found it on satellite images given to them routinely by the U.S. intelligence community;
the Americans had helped plan the bombing, perhaps persuading the Turkish military to look the other
way as the Israeli attack formation sailed over Turkey to surprise Syria by attacking from the north.
Americansâ or were they Israelis?â had perhaps snuck into the construction site before the bombing to
confirm the North Korean presence, and maybe verify the nuclear nature of the site. President George
W. Bush, uncharacteristically taciturn, flatly refused to answer a reporterâ s question about the Israeli
attack.
The one thing that most analysts agreed upon was that something strange had happened. In April
2008, the CIA took the unusual step of producing and publicly releasing a video showing clandestine
imagery from inside the facility before it was bombed. The film left little doubt that the site had been a
North Koreanâ designed nuclear facility. The story soon faded. Scant attention was paid when, seven
months later, the UNâ s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) issued its report. It had sent
inspectors to the site. What the inspectors found was not a bombed-out ruin, nor did they come upon a
beehive of renewed construction activity. Instead, the international experts were taken to a site that had
been neatly plowed and raked, a site showing no signs of debris or construction materials. It looked like
an unimproved home lot for sale in some desert community outside of Phoenix, perfectly anodyne. The
disappointed inspectors took pictures. They filled plastic ziplock baggies with soil samples and then they
left the banks of the Euphrates and flew back to their headquarters on an island in the Danube near
Vienna. There they ran tests in their laboratories.
The IAEA announced, again to little attention, that the soil samples had contained unusual,
â  man-made,â radioactive materials. For those few who had been following the mystery of Syriaâ s
Euphrates enigma, that was the end of the story, vindicating Israelâ s highly regarded intelligence service.
Despite how unlikely it seemed, Syria in fact had been secretly fooling around with nuclear weapons, and
the bizarre regime in North Korea had been helping. It was time to reassess the intentions of both
Damascus and Pyongyang.
Behind all of this mystery, however, was another intrigue. Syria had spent billions of dollars on air
defense systems. That September night, Syrian military personnel were closely watching their radars.
Unexpectedly, Israel had put its troops on the Golan Heights on full alert earlier in the day. From their
emplacements on the occupied Syrian territory, Israelâ s Golani Brigade could literally look into
downtown Damascus through their long-range lenses. Syrian forces were expecting trouble. Yet nothing
unusual appeared on their screens. The skies over Syria seemed safe and largely empty as midnight rolled
around. In fact, however, formations of Eagles and Falcons had penetrated Syrian airspace from Turkey.
Those aircraft, designed and first built in the 1970s, were far from stealthy. Their steel and titanium
airframes, their sharp edges and corners, the bombs and missiles hanging on their wings, should have lit
up the Syrian radars like the Christmas tree illuminating New Yorkâ s Rockefeller Plaza in December. But
they didnâ t.
What the Syrians slowly, reluctantly, and painfully concluded the next morning was that Israel had
â  ownedâ Damascusâ s pricey air defense network the night before. What appeared on the radar screens
was what the Israeli Air Force had put there, an image of nothing. The view seen by the Syrians bore no
relation to the reality that their eastern skies had become an Israeli Air Force bombing range. Syrian air
defense missiles could not have been fired because there had been no targets in the system for them to
seek out. Syrian air defense fighters could not have scrambled, had they been fool enough to do so again
against the Israelis, because their Russian-built systems required them to be vectored toward the target
aircraft by ground-based controllers. The Syrian ground-based controllers had seen no targets.
By that afternoon, the phones were ringing in the Russian Defense Ministry off Red Square. How
could the Russian air defense system have been blinded? Syria wanted to know. Moscow promised to
send experts and technicians right away. Maybe there had been an implementation problem, maybe a
user error, but it would be fixed immediately. The Russian military-industrial complex did not need that
Page 10
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
kind of bad publicity about its products. After all, Iran was about to buy a modern air defense radar and
missile system from Moscow. In both Tehran and Damascus, air defense commanders were in shock.
Cyber warriors around the world, however, were not surprised. This was how war would be fought in
the information age, this was Cyber War. When the term â  cyber warâ is used in this book, it refers to
actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nationâ s computers or networks for the purposes of
causing damage or disruption. When the Israelis attacked Syria, they used light and electric pulses, not to
cut like a laser or stun like a taser, but to transmit 1â s and 0â s to control what the Syrian air defense
radars saw. Instead of blowing up air defense radars and giving up the element of surprise before hitting
the main targets, in the age of cyber war, the Israelis ensured that the enemy could not even raise its
defenses.
The Israelis had planned and executed their cyber assault flawlessly. Just how they did it is a matter of
some conjecture.
There are at least three possibilities for how they â  ownedâ the Syrians. First, there is the possibility
suggested by some media reports that the Israeli attack was preceded by a stealthy unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) that intentionally flew into a Syrian air defense radarâ s beam. Radar still works essentially
the same way it began seventy years ago in the Battle of Britain. A radar system sends out a directional
radio beam. If the beam hits anything, it bounces back to a receiver. The processor then computes where
the object was that the radio beam hit, at what altitude it was flying, at what speed it was moving, and
maybe even how big an object was up there. The key fact here is that the radar is allowing an electronic
beam to come from the air, back into the ground-based computer system.
Radar is inherently an open computer door, open so that it can receive back the electronic searchers it
has sent out to look for things in the sky. A stealthy Israeli UAV might not have been seen by the Syrian
air defense because the drone would have been coated with material that absorbs or deflects a radar
beam. The UAV might, however, have been able to detect the radar beam coming up from the ground
toward it and used that very same radio frequency to transmit computer packets back down into the
radarâ s computer and from there into the Syrian air defense network. Those packets made the system
malfunction, but they also told it not to act there was anything wrong with it. They may have just replayed
a do-loop of the sky as it was before the attack. Thus, while the radar beam might later have bounced off
the attacking Eagles and Falcons, the return signal did not register on the Syrian air defense computers.
The sky would look just like it had when it was empty, even though it was, in actuality, filled with Israeli
fighters. U.S. media reports indicate that the United States has a similar cyber attack system,
code-named Senior Suter.
Second, there is the possibility that the Russian computer code controlling the Syrian air defense
network had been compromised by Israeli agents. At some point, perhaps in the Russian computer lab or
in a Syrian military facility, someone working for Israel or one of its allies may have slipped a â  trapdoorâ
into the millions of lines of computer code that run the air defense program. A â  trapdoorâ (or â  Trojan
Horseâ) is simply a handful of lines of computer code that look just like all the other gibberish that
comprise the instructions for an operating system or application. (Tests run by the National Security
Agency determined that even the best-trained experts could not, by visually looking through the millions
of lines of symbols, find the â  errorsâ that had been introduced into a piece of software.)
The â  trapdoorâ could be instructions on how to respond to certain circumstances. For example, if the
radar processor discovers a particular electronic signal, it would respond by showing no targets in the
sky for a designated period of time, say, the next three hours. All the Israeli UAV would have to do is
send down that small electronic signal. The â  trapdoorâ might be a secret electronic access point that
would allow someone tapping into the air defense network to get past the intrusion-detection system and
firewall, through the encryption, and take control of the network with full administratorâ s rights and
privileges.
The third possibility is that an Israeli agent would find any fiber-optic cable of the air defense network
somewhere in Syria and splice into the line (harder than it sounds, but doable). Once on line, the Israeli
agent would type in a command that would cause the â  trapdoorâ to open for him. While it is risky for an
Israeli agent to be wandering around Syria cutting into fiber-optic cables, it is far from impossible.
Page 11
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Reports have suggested for decades that Israel places its spies behind Syrian borders. The fiber-optic
cables for the Syrian national air defense network run all over the country, not just inside military
installations. The advantage of an agent in place hacking into the network is that it does not cause the
operation to rely upon the success of a â  takeover packetâ entering the network from a UAV flying
overhead. Indeed, an agent in place could theoretically set up a link from his location back to Israelâ s Air
Force command post. Using low-probability-of-intercept (LPI) communications methods, an Israeli
agent may be able to establish â  cove commsâ (covert communications), even in downtown Damascus,
beaming up to a satellite with little risk of anyone in Syria noticing.
Whatever method the Israelis used to trick the Syrian air defense network, it was probably taken from
a playbook they borrowed from the U.S. Our Israeli friends have learned a thing or two from the
programs we have been working on for more than two decades. In 1990, as the United States was
preparing to go to war with Iraq for the first time, early U.S. cyber warriors got together with Special
Operations commandos to figure out how they could take out the extensive Iraqi air defense radar and
missile network just before the initial waves of U.S. and allied aircraft came screeching in toward
Baghdad. As the hero of Desert Storm, four-star General Norm Schwarzkopf, explained to me at the
time, â  these snake-eaters had some crazy ideaâ to sneak into Iraq before the first shots were fired and
seize control of a radar base in the south of the country. They planned to bring with them some hackers,
probably from the U.S. Air Force, who would hook up to the Iraqi network from inside the base and
then send out a program that would have caused all the computers on the network all over the country to
crash and be unable to reboot.
Schwarzkopf thought the plan risky and unreliable. He had a low opinion of U.S. Special Operations
Command and feared that the commandos would become the first Americans held as prisoners of war,
even before the war started. Even worse, he feared that the Iraqis would be able to turn their computers
back on and would start shooting down some of the two thousand sorties of attacks he planned for the
first day of the air war. â  If you want to make sure their air defense radars and missiles donâ t work, blow
them up first. That way they stay dead. Then go in and bomb your targets.â Thus, most of the initial U.S.
and allied air sorties were not bombing raids on Baghdad headquarters or Iraqi Army divisions, they
were on the air defense radar and missile sites. Some U.S. aircraft were destroyed in those attempts,
some pilots were killed, and some were taken prisoner.
When, thirteen years later, the U.S. went to war with Iraq a second time, well before the initial waves
of American fighter-bombers swept in, the Iraqi military knew that their â  closed-loopâ private, secure
military network had already been compromised. The Americans told them.
Thousands of Iraqi military officers received e-mails on the Iraqi Defense Ministry e-mail system just
before the war started. Although the exact text has never been made public, several reliable sources
revealed enough of the gist to reconstruct what you might have read had you been, say, an Iraqi Army
brigadier general in charge of an armored unit outside of Basra. It would have read something like this:
This is a message from United States Central Command. As you know, we may be instructed to
invade Iraq in the near future. If we do so, we will overwhelm forces that oppose us, as we did several
years ago. We do not want to harm you or your troops. Our goal would be to displace Saddam and
his two sons. If you wish to remain unharmed, place your tanks and other armored vehicles in
formation and abandon them. Walk away. You and your troops should go home. You and other Iraqi
forces will be reconstituted after the regime is changed in Baghdad.
Not surprisingly, many Iraqi officers obeyed the instructions CENTCOM had e-mailed them, on the
secret Iraqi network. U.S. troops found many units had neatly parked their tanks in rows outside their
bases, thus allowing U.S. aircraft to neatly blow them up. Some Iraqi army commanders sent their troops
on leave in the hours before the war. Troops put on civilian clothes and went home, or at least tried to.
Although willing to hack into Iraqâ s network to engage in a psychological campaign prior to the onset
of the conventional attack, the Bush Administration was apparently unwilling to destroy Saddam Husseinâ 
s financial assets by cracking into the networks of banks in Iraq and other countries. The capability to do
so existed, but government lawyers feared that raiding bank accounts would be seen by other nations as
a violation of international law, and viewed as a precedent. The counsels also feared unintended
Page 12

consequences if the U.S. cyber bank robberies hit the wrong accounts or took out entire financial
institutions.
The second U.S.-Iraq war, and the more recent Israeli attack on Syria, had demonstrated two uses of
cyber war. One use of cyber war is to make a conventional (the U.S. military prefers the term â  kineticâ)
attack easier by disabling the enemyâ s defenses. Another use of cyber war is to send propaganda out to
demoralize the enemy, distributing e-mails and other Internet media in place of the former practice of
dropping pamphlets. (Recall the thousands of pieces of paper with instructions in Arabic and stick-figure
drawings dropped on Iraqi forces in 1991, telling them how to surrender to U.S. forces. Thousands of
Iraqis brought the pamphlets with them when they did surrender.)
The raid on the Syrian nuclear facility and the U.S. cyber activity that preceded the invasion of Iraq are
examples of the military using hacking as a tool to assist in a more familiar kind of war. The use of
cyberspace by nation-states for political, diplomatic, and military goals does not, however, have to be
accompanied by bombing raids or tank battles. A small taste of what a stand-alone cyber war could look
like came, somewhat surprisingly, in a little Hanseatic League city of 400,000 people on the shores of the
Baltic. The city of Tallinn had become, once again, the capital of an independent Estonia in 1989 when
the Soviet Union disintegrated and many of its component republics disassociated themselves from
Moscow and the U.S.S.R. Estonia had been forced to become part of the Soviet Union when the Red
Army â  liberatedâ the Baltic republic from the Nazis during what the Russians call â  the Great Patriotic
War.â
The Red Army, or at least the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, didnâ t want Estonians, or any
other East Europeans, to forget the sacrifices that were made â  liberatingâ them. Thus, in Tallinn, as in
most East European capitals, they erected one of those giant, heroic statues of a Red Army soldier that
the Soviet leaders had such a fondness for. Often these bronzes stood atop the graves of Red Army
soldiers. I first stumbled upon such a statue, almost literally, in Vienna in 1974. When I asked the police
protecting it why neutral Austria had a giant Communist soldier in its downtown, they told me that the
Soviet Union had put it up right after the war and had required the Austrians to promise never to take it
down. Indeed, the statue is specifically protected in the treaty the U.S. and Austria signed, along with the
Soviets, when American and Soviet troops left Austria in 1950. Back in the 1970s, the Viennese almost
uniformly described the enormous bronze as â  the only Russian soldier in Vienna who did not rape our
women.â It seems these statues mean a great deal to the Russians, just as the overseas graves of
American World War II dead are sacred ground to many American veterans, their families, and their
descendants. The giant bronze statues also had significant meaning to those who were â  liberated,â but
that meaning was something entirely different. The statues and the dead bodies of Red Army soldiers
under them were, symbolically, lightning rods. In Tallinn, the statue also attracted cyber lightning.
Tensions between ethnic Russians living in Estonia and the native Estonians themselves had been
building ever since the little nation had declared its independence again at the end of the Cold War. The
majority of Estonians sought to remove any sign of the five oppressive decades during which they had
been forced to be part of the Soviet Union. In February 2007, the legislature passed a Forbidden
Structures Law that would have caused anything denoting the occupation to be taken down, including the
giant bronze soldier. Estonians still resented the desecration of their own veteransâ  graves that had
followed the appearance of the Red Army.
Moscow complained that moving the bronze soldier would defame the heroic Soviet dead, including
those buried around the giant bronze. Seeking to avoid an incident, the Estonian President vetoed the
law. But public pressure to remove the statue grew, just as a Russian ethnic group dedicated to
protecting the monument and an Estonian nationalist group threatening to destroy it became increasingly
militant. As the Baltic winter warmed into spring, the politics moved to the street. On April 27, 2007,
now known as Bronze Night, a riot broke out between radicals from both ethnic factions, with the police
and the statue caught in the middle. Authorities quickly intervened and moved the statue to a new,
protected location in the military cemetery. Far from quelling the dispute, the move ignited indignant
nationalist responses in the Moscow media and in Russiaâ s legislature, the Duma.

This is when the conflict moved into cyberspace. Estonia, oddly, is one of the most wired nations in the
world, ranking, along with South Korea, well ahead of the United States in the extent of its broadband
penetration and its utilization of Internet applications in everyday life. Those advances made it a perfect
target for cyber attack. After Bronze Night, suddenly the servers supporting the most often utilized
webpages in Estonia were flooded with cyber access requests, so flooded that some of the servers
collapsed under the load and shut down. Other servers were so jammed with incoming pings that they
were essentially inaccessible. Estonians could not use their online banking, their newspapersâ  websites, or
their governmentâ s electronic services.
What had hit Estonia was a DDOS, a distributed denial of service attack. Normally a DDOS is
considered a minor nuisance, not a major weapon in the cyber arsenal. Basically it is a preprogrammed
flood of Internet traffic designed to crash or jam networks. It is â  distributedâ in the sense that thousands,
even hundreds of thousands, of computers are engaged in sending the electronic pings to a handful of
targeted locations on the Internet. The attacking computers are called a â  botnet,â a robotic network, of
â  zombies,â computers that are under remote control. The attacking zombies were following instructions
that had been loaded onto them without their ownersâ  knowledge. Indeed, the owners usually cannot
even tell when their computers have become zombies or are engaged in a DDOS. A user may notice that
the laptop is running a little slowly or that accessing webpages is taking a little longer than normal, but that
is the only indicator. The malicious activity is all taking place in the background, not appearing on the user
â s screen. Your computer, right now, might be part of a botnet.
What has happened, often weeks or months before a botnet went on the offensive, is that a computerâ 
s user went to an innocent-looking webpage and that page secretly downloaded the software that turned
their computer into a zombie. Or they opened an e-mail, perhaps even one from someone they knew,
that downloaded the zombie software. Updated antivirus or firewall software may catch and block the
infections, but hackers are constantly discovering new ways around these defenses.
Sometimes the zombie computer sits patiently awaiting orders. Other times it begins to look for other
computers to attack. When one computer spreads its infection to others, and they in turn do the same,
we have the phenomenon known as a â  worm,â the infection worming its way from one computer through
thousands to millions. An infection can spread across the globe in mere hours.
In Estonia the DDOS was the largest ever seen. It appeared that several different botnets, each with
tens of thousands of infected machines that had been sleeping, were now at work. At first, the Estonians
thought that the takedown of some of their webpages was just an annoyance sent at them from outraged
Russians. Then the botnets started targeting Internet addresses most people would not know, not those
of public webpages, but the addresses of servers running parts of the telephone network, the credit-card
verification system, and the Internet directory. Now over a million computers were engaged in sending a
flood of pings toward the servers they were targeting in Estonia. Hansapank, the nationâ s largest bank,
was staggered. Commerce and communications nationwide were being affected. And the attacks did not
stop.
In most previous eruptions of a DDOS attack, one site would be hit for a few days. This was
something different. Hundreds of key sites in one country were being hit week after week, unable to get
back up. As Internet security experts rushed to Tallinn from Europe and North America, Estonia brought
the matter before the North Atlantic Council, the highest body of the NATO military alliance. An ad hoc
incident response team began trying countermeasures that had been successful in the past with smaller
DDOS attacks. The zombies adapted, probably being reprogrammed by the master computers. The
attacks continued. Using trace-back techniques, cyber security experts followed the attacking pings to
specific zombie computers and then watched to see when the infected machines â  phoned homeâ to their
masters. Those messages were traced to controlling machines, and sometimes further traced to
higher-level controlling devices. Estonia claimed that the ultimate controlling machines were in Russia, and
that the computer code involved had been written on Cyrillic-alphabet keyboards.
The Russian government indignantly denied that it was engaged in cyber war against Estonia. It also
refused Estoniaâ s formal diplomatic request for assistance in tracing the attackers, although a standing
bilateral agreement required Moscow to cooperate. Informed that the attacks had been traced back to
Page 14
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Russia, some government officials admitted that it was possible perhaps that patriotic Russians, incensed
at what Estonia had done, were taking matters into their own hands. Perhaps.
But even if the â  patriotic Russiansâ theory were to be believed, it left unanswered the question of why
the Russian government would not move to stop such vigilantism. No one doubted for a minute that the
KGBâ s successors had the ability to find the culprits and to block the traffic. Others, more familiar with
modern Russia, suggested that what was at work was far more than a passive Russian police turning a
blind eye to the hooliganism of overly nationalistic youth. The most adept hackers in Russia, apart from
those who are actual government employees, are usually in the service of organized crime. Organized
crime is allowed to flourish because of its unacknowledged connection to the security services. Indeed,
the distinction between organized criminal networks and the security services that control most Russian
ministries and local governments is often blurry. Many close observers of Russia think that some senior
government officials permit organized crime activity for a slice of the profits, or, as in the case of Estonia,
for help with messy tasks. Think of Marlon Brando as the Godfather saying, â  Somedayâ ¦I will call upon
you to do a service for meâ ¦â
After Bronze Night, the Russian security services had encouraged domestic media outlets to whip up
patriotic sentiment against Estonia. It is not a stretch to imagine that they also asked organized crime
groups to launch the hackers in their employ, perhaps even giving those hackers some information that
would prove helpful. Did the Russian government security ministries engage in cyber attacks on Estonia?
Perhaps that is not the right question. Did they suggest the attacks, facilitate them, refuse to investigate or
punish them? And, in the end, does the distinction really matter when you are an Estonian unable to get
your money out of a Hansapank ATM?
Following the cyber attack, NATO moved to create a cyber defense center. It opened in 2008, a few
miles from the site where the giant bronze solider had originally stood. On the original site of the bronze
soldier there is a nice little grove of trees now. Unfortunately, the NATO center in Tallinn was of little use
when another former Soviet satellite republic, Georgia, and Mother Russia got into a tussle over some
small disputed provinces.
The Republic of Georgia lies directly south of Russia along the Black Sea, and the two nations have
had a decidedly unequal relationship for well over a century. Georgia is geographically slightly smaller
than the state of South Carolina and has a population of about four million people. Given its location and
size, Georgia has been viewed by Moscow as properly within the Kremlinâ s â  sphere of influence.â When
the original Russian empire began to disintegrate after the Russian Revolution, the Georgians tried to
make a break for it while the Russians were too busy fighting each other, declaring Georgian
independence in 1918. As soon as the Russians finished fighting each other, however, the victorious Red
Army quickly invaded Georgia, installed a puppet regime, and made Georgia part of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics. Soviet control of Georgia lasted until 1991, when, as the central Russian government
was again in turmoil, Georgia once more took the opportunity to declare independence.
Two years later, Georgia lost control of two territories, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Supported by
Moscow, the local Russian populations in those territories succeeded in defeating the ragtag Georgian
army and expelling most Georgians. The territories then set up â  independentâ governments. Although still
legally part of Georgia as far as the rest of the world was concerned, the regions relied on Russian
funding and protection. Then, in July 2008, South Ossetian rebels (or Russian agents, depending upon
whose version of events you trust) provoked a conflict with Georgia by staging a series of missile raids on
Georgian villages.
The Georgian army, predictably, responded to the missile strikes on its territory by bombing the South
Ossetian capital city. Then, on August 7, Georgia invaded the region. Not surprised by this turn of
events, the Russian army moved the next day, quickly ejecting the Georgian army from South Ossetia.
Precisely at the same time that the Russian army moved, so did its cyber warriors. Their goal was to
prevent Georgians from learning what was going on, so they streamed DDOS attacks on Georgian media
outlets and government websites. Georgiaâ s access to CNN and BBC websites were also blocked.
In the physical world, the Russians also bombed Georgia and took over a small chunk of Georgian
Page 15
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
territory that was not in dispute, allegedly to create a â  buffer zone.â While the Georgian army was busy
getting routed in Ossetia, rebel groups in Abkhazia decided to take advantage of the situation and push
out any remaining Georgians, with a little help from their Russian backers. The Russian army then took
another little slice of Georgian land, as an additional buffer. Five days later, most of the fighting was over.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy brokered a peace agreement in which the Russians agreed to
withdraw from Georgia immediately and to leave the disputed territories once an international
peacekeeping force arrived to fill the security vacuum. That force never arrived, and within a few weeks
Russia recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states. The declared independent states
then invited their Russian benefactors to stay.
To most in the U.S., except then presidential candidate John McCain, who tried to portray it as a
national security crisis for America, all of this activity in Georgia seemed remote and unimportant. As
soon as most Americans reassured themselves that the news reports they heard about the invasion of
Georgia did not really mean Russian army troops or General Sherman again marching on Atlanta, they
tuned out. The eventâ s true significance, beyond what it revealed of the Russian rulersâ  thinking about
their former empire, lies in what it exposed of their attitudes toward the use of cyber attacks.
Before fighting broke out in the physical world, cyber attacks hit Georgian government sites. In the
initial stages, the attackers conducted basic DDOS attacks on Georgian government websites and
hacked into the web server of the Presidentâ s site to deface it, adding pictures that compared the
Georgian leader, Mikheil Saakashvili, to Adolf Hitler. It had seemed trivial, even juvenile, at first. Then
the cyber attacks picked up in intensity and sophistication just as the ground fighting broke out.
Georgia connects to the Internet through Russia and Turkey. Most of the routers in Russia and Turkey
that send traffic on to Georgia were so flooded with incoming attacks that no outbound traffic could get
through. Hackers seized direct control of the rest of the routers supporting traffic to Georgia. The effect
was that Georgians could not connect to any outside news or information sources and could not send
e-mail out of the country. Georgia effectively lost control of the nationâ s â  .geâ domain and was forced to
shift many government websites to servers outside the country.
The Georgians tried to defend their cyberspace and engage in â  work-aroundsâ to foil the DDOS
attack. The Russians countered every move. Georgia tried to block all traffic coming from Russia. The
Russians rerouted their attacks, appearing as packets from China. In addition to a Moscow-based
master controller for all the botnets being used in the attacks, servers in Canada, Turkey, and, ironically,
Estonia were also used to run botnets.
Georgia transfered the Presidentâ s webpage to a server on Googleâ s blogspot in California. The
Russians then set up mock presidential sites and directed traffic to them. The Georgian banking sector
shut down its servers and planned to ride out the attacks, thinking that a temporary loss of online banking
was a better bargain than risking the theft of critical data or damage to internal systems. Unable to get to
the Georgian banks, the Russians had their botnets send a barrage of traffic to the international banking
community, pretending to be cyber attacks from Georgia. The attacks triggered an automated response
at most of the foreign banks, which shut down connections to the Georgian banking sector. Without
access to European settlement systems, Georgiaâ s banking operations were paralyzed. Credit card
systems went down as well, followed soon after by the mobile phone system.
At their peak, the DDOS attacks were coming from six different botnets using both computers
commandeered from unsuspecting Internet users and from volunteers who downloaded hacker software
from several anti-Georgia websites. After installing the software, a volunteer could join the cyber war by
clicking on a button labeled â  Start Flood.â
As in the Estonian incident, the Russian government claimed that the cyber attacks were a populist
response that was beyond the control of the Kremlin. A group of Western computer scientists, however,
concluded that the websites used to launch the attacks were linked to the Russian intelligence apparatus.
The level of coordination shown in the attacks and the financing necessary to orchestrate them suggest
this was no casual cyber crusade triggered by patriotic fervor. Even if the Russian government were to be
believed (namely, that the cyber storm let loose on Georgia, like the previous one on Estonia, was not the
work of its official agents), it is very clear that the government did nothing to stop it. After all, the huge
Page 16
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Soviet intelligence agency, the KGB, is still around, although with a slightly different organizational
structure and name. Indeed the KGBâ s power has only increased under the regime of its alumnus,
Vladimir Putin. Any large-scale cyber activity in Russia, whether done by government, organized crime,
or citizens, is done with the approval of the intelligence apparatus and its bosses in the Kremlin.
If it was, as we suspect, effectively the Russian government that asked for the â  vigilanteâ DDOS and
other cyber attacks as a stand-alone punishment of Estonia and later conducted them as an
accompaniment to kinetic war on Georgia, those operations do not begin to reveal what the Russian
military and intelligence agencies could do if they were truly on the attack in cyberspace. The Russians, in
fact, showed considerable restraint in the use of their cyber weapons in the Estonian and Georgian
episodes. The Russians are probably saving their best cyber weapons for when they really need them, in
a conflict in which NATO and the United States are involved.
For years U.S. intelligence officials had thought that if any nation were going to use cyber weapons, even
in the small ways demonstrated in Estonia and Georgia, the likely first movers would be Russia, China,
Israel, and, of course, the United States. The nation that joined that club in the summer of 2009 came as
a surprise to some.
It was a little after seven p.m. in Reston, Virginia, on the last Monday in May 2009. Outside, the
rush-hour traffic was beginning to thin on the nearby Dulles Airport Access Road. Inside, a flat screen at
the U.S. Geological Survey had just indicated a 4.7 magnitude earthquake in Asia. The seismic experts
began narrowing in on the epicenter. It was in the northeastern corner of the Korean Peninsula,
specifically forty-three miles from a town on the map called Kimchaek. The data showed that there had
been a similar event very nearby in October 2006. That one had turned out to be a nuclear explosion. So
did this one.
After years of negotiating with the U.S., as well as with China and Russia, the weird, hermetic
government of North Korea had decided to defy international pressure and explode a nuclear bomb, for
the second time. Their first attempt, three years earlier, had been characterized by some Western
observers as something like a â  partial fizzle.â In the ensuing hours after this second blast, U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations Susan E. Rice was attached to the phone in her suite at New Yorkâ s
Waldorf Towers. She consulted with the White House and the State Department, then she began to call
other UN ambassadors, notably the Japanese and South Koreans. The South Korean who is the head of
the UN, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, agreed to an emergency meeting of the Security Council. The
outcome of that feverish round of diplomatic consultations was, eventually, further international
condemnation of North Korea and further sanctions on the impoverished tyranny. A decade and a halfâ s
worth of diplomacy to prevent a North Korean nuclear capability had come to naught. Why?
Some observers of the Pyongyang government explained that the destitute North had no other
leverage to extract concessionary loans, free food, and gifts of oil. It had to keep selling the same thing
over and over, a promise not to go further with its nuclear capability. Others pointed to the rumored ill
health of the strange man known in the North as the Dear One, Kim Jong-il, the leader of the Democratic
Peopleâ s Republic of Korea. The tea-leaf readers believed that the Dear One knew that he was fading
and had selected Number Three Son, Kim Jong-un, a twenty-five-year-old, to succeed him. To prevent
the United States, or South Korea, from taking advantage of the transition period, the analysts claimed,
the North believed it had to rattle its sabers, or at least its atoms. The pattern with North Korea in the
past had been to threaten, get attention, give a taste of what awful things might happen, then offer to talk,
and eventually to cut a deal to enrich their coffers.
If the detonation was designed to provoke the United States and others to rush with offers of wheat
and oil, it failed. Having condemned the explosion and announced the movement of defensive missiles to
Hawaii, as June moved on, the U.S. leadership shifted its focus back to health care reform, Afghanistan,
and self-flagellation over its own intelligence activities. Somewhere in the bureaucracy an American
official publicly announced that the U.S. would again be conducting a cyber war exercise known as
Cyber Storm to test the defense of computer networks. The 2009 exercise would involve other nations,
including Japan and Korea, the one in the south. North Korean media soon responded by characterizing
Page 17
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
the pending exercise as a cover for an invasion of North Korea. That kind of bizarre and paranoid
analysis is par for the course with North Korea. No one in Washington thought twice about it.
As the July 4 break began in Washington, bureaucrats scattered to vacation homes on East Coast
beaches. Tourists in Washington swarmed to the National Mall, where a crowd of several hundred
thousand watched the â  rocketsâ  red glareâ of a sensational fireworks display, a signature of the Fourth of
July holiday. On the other side of the world, the association of rockets and the Fourth was not lost on
some in the North Korean leadership. In outer space, a U.S. satellite detected a rocket launch from
North Korea. Computers in Colorado quickly determined that the rocket was short-ranged and was
fired into the sea. Then there was another rocket launch. Then another and another. Seven North Korean
rockets were fired on the Fourth of July. Whether a plea for help, or more saber rattling, it certainly
seemed like a cry for attention. But that cry did not stop there. It moved into cyberspace.
Right before the Fourth of July holiday, a coded message was sent out by a North Korean agent to
about 40,000 computers around the world that were infected with a botnet virus. The message contained
a simple set of instructions telling the computer to start pinging a list of U.S. and South Korean
government websites and international companies. Whenever the infected computers were turned on,
they silently joined the assault. If your computer was one of the zombies, you might have noticed your
processor was running slowly and your Web requests were taking a bit longer to process, but nothing
too out of the ordinary. Yes, it was another DDOS attack by zombies in a botnet. At some time over the
weekend, the U.S. government did notice when dhs.gov and state.gov became temporarily unavailable. If
anyone actually thought of consulting the Department of Homeland Security terrorist threat level before
deciding to go watch the fireworks on the National Mall, they would not have been able to gain that
information from the Department of Homeland Securityâ s website.
Each of those zombie computers was flooding these sites with requests to see their pages in another
distributed denial of service attack. The U.S. websites were hit with as many as 1 million requests per
second, choking the servers. The Treasury, Secret Service, Federal Trade Commission, and Department
of Transportation web servers were all brought down at some point between July 4 and July 9. The
NASDAQ, New York Mercantile, and New York Stock Exchange sites were also hit, as was the 
Washington Post. The DDOS aimed at the White House failed, however. To prevent the first DDOS
attack against the White House in 1999, I had arranged with a company known as Akamai to route
traffic seeking the White House website to the nearest of over 20,000 servers scattered around the
world. When the Korean attack hit in 2009, the DDOS went to the White House servers nearest the
source of the attacker. Thus, only sites hosting the White House website in Asia had trouble. White
House spokesperson Nick Shapiro apologized in a halfhearted way to any web surfers in Asia who might
not have been able to get onto the White House site. Then the second and third waves hit.
Another 30,000 to 60,000 computers infected with a different variant of the virus were told to target a
dozen or more South Korean government sites, Korean banks, and a South Korean Internet security
company on July 9. The attackers were apparently convinced that the attacks on U.S. sites were no
longer going to be effective after the government and major corporations began working with Internet
service providers (ISPs) to filter out the attacks. At 6:00 p.m. Korea time on July 10, the final assault
began. The now estimated 166,000 computers in seventy-four countries started flooding the sites of
Korean banks and government agencies.
Ultimately, the damage was contained. The attack did not attempt to gain control of any government
systems, nor did it disrupt any essential services. But it was likely only meant as a shot across the bow.
What we do know is that there was an agenda and motivation for the attack. This was not a worm simply
released into the wilds of the Internet and allowed to propagate. Someone controlled and directed the
attack and modified its target list to focus on the more vulnerable Korean sites.
The U.S. government has yet to directly attribute the attack to North Korea, though South Korea has
not been shy about doing so. The timing of the attacks does suggest the North Korean regime is the
prime suspect, but definite attribution is difficult. The infected computers attempted to contact one of
eight â  command and control serversâ every three minutes. These servers sent instructions back to the
infected zombie computers, telling them which websites to attack. The eight masters were in South
Page 18
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Korea, the United States, Germany, Austria, and, interestingly, Georgia (the country).
The Korea Communications Commission has endorsed the judgment of a Vietnamese firm, Bach
Khoa Internetwork Security (BKIS), that these eight servers were controlled from a server in Brighton,
England. From there, the trail goes cold, though it does not look like the mastermind behind the attack
was sitting in front of a keyboard near the beach in Brighton. South Koreaâ s National Intelligence Service
(NIS) suspects that a North Korean military research institute set up to destroy South Koreaâ s
communications infrastructure was involved. The NIS said in a statement following the attack that it had
evidence that pointed to North Korea.
The NIS maintains that the North Korean hacker unit, known as Lab 110, or the â  technology
reconnaissance team,â was ordered to prepare a plan for cyber attack on June 7. That order directed the
unit to â  destroy the South Korean puppet communications networks in an instant,â following the decision
by the South Koreans to participate in Excercise Cyber Storm. The North called the exercise â  an
intolerable provocation as it revealed ambition to invade the DPRK.â
South Korea is now preparing for all-out cyber war with the North. Just before the attacks began,
South Korea had announced plans for establishing a cyber warfare command by 2012. After the attacks,
it sped up the timeline to January 2010. What the Southâ s new cyber warfare command will do the next
time the North attacks in cyberspace is unclear.
If North Korea attacks in cyberspace again, options for responding are relatively limited. Sanctions
cannot be made much tighter. Suspended food aid cannot be suspended further. Any military action in
retaliation is out of the question. The 23 million residents of metropolitan Seoul live within range of North
Koreaâ s artillery pieces, set along the demilitarized zone in what military planners refer to as â  the kill
box.â
There is also little possibility of responding in kind, since North Korea has little for either U.S. or
South Korean cyber warriors to attack. In 2002, Donald Rumsfeld and other Bush Administration
officials advocated the invasion of Iraq because Afghanistan was not a â  target richâ environment, with not
enough military hardware, bases, or major infrastructure for the U.S. to blow up. North Korea is the
cyber equivalent of Afghanistan.
Nightearth.com compiled satellite photos of the planet at night taken from space. Its composite map
shows a well-lit planet. South Korea looks like a bright island separated from China and Japan by the
sea. What looks like the sea, the Korean peninsula north of Seoul, is almost completely dark. North
Korea barely has an electric grid. Fewer than 20,000 of North Koreaâ s 23 million citizens have cell
phones. Radios and TVs are hardwired to tune only into official government channels. And as far as the
Internet is concerned, the New York Timesâ s judgment from 2006 that North Korea is a â  black holeâ
still stands. The Economist described the country as â  almost as cut off from the virtual world as it is from
the real one.â North Korea operates about thirty websites for external communication with the rest of the
world, mostly to spread propaganda about its neighbor to the south. A handful of Western hotels are
permitted satellite access, and North Korea does run a limited internal network for a few lucky citizens
who can go to the Dear Oneâ s website, but almost nowhere else.
While North Korea may not have invested much in developing an Internet infrastructure, it has
invested in taking down the infrastucture in other countries. Unit 110, the unit suspected of carrying out
the July cyber attacks, is only one of North Koreaâ s four cycle warfare units. The Korean Peopleâ s
Army (KPA) Joint Chiefs Cyber Warfare Unit 121 has over 600 hackers. The Enemy Secret
Department Cyber Psychological Warfare Unit 204 has 100 hackers and specializes in cyber elements of
information warfare. The Central Partyâ s Investigations Department Unit 35 is a smaller but highly
capable cyber unit with both internal security functions and external offensive cyber capabilities. Unit 121
is by far the largest and, according to one former hacker who defected in 2004, the best trained. The unit
specializes in disabling South Koreaâ s military command, control, and communications networks. It has
elements stationed in China because the Internet connections in North Korea are so few and so easily
identified. Whether the Beijing government knows the full extent of the North Korean presence and
activity is unclear, but few things escape Chinaâ s secret police, particularly on the the Internet. One North
Korean cyber war unit is reportedly located at the Shanghai Hotel in the Chinese town of Dandong, on
Page 19
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
the North Korean border. Four floors are allegedly rented out to Unit 110 agents. Another unit is in the
town of Sunyang, where North Korean agents have reportedly rented out several floors in the Myohyang
Hotel. Agents have apparently been spotted moving fiber-optic cables and state-of-the-art computer
network equipment into these properties. All told, North Korea may have from 600 to 1,000 KPA
cyber warfare agents acting in cells in the PRC, under a commander with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
North Korea selects elite students at the elementary-school level to be groomed as future hackers. These
students are trained on programming and computer hardware in middle and high school, after which they
automatically enroll at the Command Automation University in Pyongyang, where their sole academic
focus is to learn how to hack into enemy network systems. Currently 700 students are reportedly
enrolled. They conduct regular cyber warfare simulated exercises against each other, and some infiltrate
Japan to learn the latest computer skills.
The July 2009 attack, though not devastating, was fairly sophisticated. The fact that it was controlled
and not simply released to do damage indiscriminately shows that the attackers knew what they were
doing. The fact that it lasted for so many days is also a testament to the effort put into propagating the
virus from several sources. These attributes suggest that the attack was not the work of some teenagers
with too much time on their hands. Of course, North Korea sought â  deniability,â creating sufficient doubt
about who did the attack so that they could claim it was not them.
While researchers have found that part of the program was written using a Korean-language web
browser, that would just as likely implicate South Korean hackers for hire, of which there are many in
that highly wired nation. These same researchers, however, are troubled by the fact that the code writer
didnâ t try to disguise its Korean origin. Someone sophisticated enough to write the code should also have
been sophisticated enough to cover his or her tracks. Perhaps whoever ordered the code written wanted
that clue to be found.
The South Korean government and many analysts in the United States concluded that the person who
ordered the attack was the Dear One, and that he had demonstrated North Koreaâ s strength in
cyberspace at the same time that he had done so with the rocket barrage. The message was: I am still in
charge and I can make trouble with weapons that can eliminate your conventional superiority. Having
sent that message, a few weeks later North Korean diplomats offered an alternative. They were
prepared to talk, even to free two American prisoners. Shortly thereafter, in a scene reminiscent of the
movie Team America: World Police, Bill Clinton was sitting down with the Dear One. Unlike the
marionette portraying UN nuclear inspector Hans Blix in the movie, Clinton did not drop through a
trapdoor into a shark tank, but it seemed likely that North Korea had placed trapdoors on computer
networks on at least two continents.
Months after the July 2009 North Korean cyber activity, Pentagon analysts concluded that the
purpose of the DDOS attacks may have been to determine what level of botnet activity from South
Korea would be sufficient to jam the fiber-optic cables and routers leading out of the country. If North
Korean agents in South Korea could flood the connection, they could effectively cut the country off from
any Internet connection to the rest of the world. That would be valuable for the North to do in a crisis,
because the U.S. employs those connections to coordinate the logistics of any U.S. military
reinforcements. The North Korean preparation of the cyber battlefield continued. In October, three
months after the DDOS attacks, South Korean media outlets reported that hackers had infiltrated the
Chemicals Accident Response Information System and had withdrawn a significant amount of classified
information on 1,350 hazardous chemicals. The hackers, believed to be North Koreans, obtained access
to the system through malicious code implanted in the computer of a South Korean army officer. It took
seven months for the South Koreans to discover the hack. North Korea now knows how and where
South Korea stores its hazardous gases, including chlorine used for water purification. When chlorine is
released into the atmosphere, it can cause death by asphyxiation, as demonstrated horribly on the
battlefields of World War I.
The new â  cyber warriorsâ and much of the media herald these incidents as the first public clashes of
nation-states in cyberspace. There are other examples, including operations by China, Taiwan, Israel,
Page 20
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
and others. Some have called the Estonian case â  WWIâ, that is, Web War One.
Others look at these and other recent incidents and do not see a new kind of warfare. They see in the
Israeli attack a new form of airborne electronic jamming, something that has been happening in other
ways for almost half a century. The American actions in Iraq appear to these doubters to be marginal and
mainly propaganda. In the Russian and North Korean activities the doubters see only harassment and
nuisance-value disruption.
Of course, the Syrians, Iraqis, Estonians, Georgians, and South Koreans saw these events as far more
than a nuisance. I tend to agree. I have walked through these recent, well-known cyber clashes mainly to
demonstrate that nation-state conflict involving cyber attacks has begun. Beyond that incontestable
observation, however, there are five â  take-awaysâ from these incidents:
Cyber war is real. What we have seen so far is far from indicative of what can be done. Most of these
well-known skirmishes in cyberspace used only primitive cyber weapons (with the notable exception
of the Israeli operation). It is a reasonable guess that the attackers did not want to reveal their more
sophisticated capabilities, yet. What the United States and other nations are capable of doing in a
cyber war could devastate a modern nation.
Cyber war happens at the speed of light. As the photons of the attack packets stream down
fiber-optic cable, the time between the launch of an attack and its effect is barely measurable, thus
creating risks for crisis decision makers.
Cyber war is global. In any conflict, cyber attacks rapidly go global, as covertly acquired or hacked
computers and servers throughout the world are kicked into service. Many nations are quickly drawn
in.
Cyber war skips the battlefield. Systems that people rely upon, from banks to air defense radars, are
accessible from cyberspace and can be quickly taken over or knocked out without first defeating a
countryâ s traditional defenses.
Cyber war has begun. In anticipation of hostilities, nations are already â  preparing the battlefield.â They
are hacking into each otherâ s networks and infrastructures, laying in trapdoors and logic bombsâ now,
in peacetime. This ongoing nature of cyber war, the blurring of peace and war, adds a dangerous new
dimension of instability.
As later chapters will discuss, there is every reason to believe that most future kinetic wars will be
accompanied by cyber war, and that other cyber wars will be conducted as â  stand-aloneâ activities,
without explosions, infantry, airpower, and navies. There has not yet, however, been a full-scale cyber
war in which the leading nations in this kind of combat employ their most sophisticated tools against each
other. Thus, we really do not know who would win, nor what the results of such a cyber war would be.
This book will lay out why the unpredictability associated with full-scale cyber war means that there is a
credible possibility that such conflict may have the potential to change the world military balance and
thereby fundamentally alter political and economic relations. And it will suggest ways to reduce that
unpredictability.

CHAPTER TWO
CYBER WARRIORS
In a television ad, a crew-cut young man in a jumpsuit walks around a darkened command center,
chatting with subordinates who are illuminated by the greenish light from their computer screens. We hear
his voice over the video: â  control of power systemsâ ¦water systemsâ ¦that is the new battlefieldâ ¦in the
future this is going to be the premier war-fighting domainâ ¦this is going to be where the major battles are
fought.â He then looks right at the camera and says, â  I am Captain Scott Hinck, and I am an Air Force
Cyber Warrior.â The screen fades to black, and then three words appear: â  Air, Space, Cyberspace.â
Then, as the ad ends, we see a winged symbol and the name of the sponsor, â  United States Air Force.â
So now we know what one cyber warrior looks like. At least in Scottâ s case, he looks a lot like the
bright, fit, earnest officers who populate the worldâ s most potent military. That is not quite our image of
hackers, whom movies have portrayed as acned, disheveled guys with thick glasses. To attract more of
those with the skills needed to understand how to fight cyber war, however, the Air Force seems to think
it may have to bend the rules. â  If they canâ t run three miles with a pack on their back, but they can shut
down a SCADA system,â mused Air Force Major General William Lord, â  we need to have a culture
where they can fit in.â (A SCADA system is the software that controls networks such as electric power
grids.) That progressive attitude reflects the U.S. Air Forceâ s strong desire to play the leading role for the
U.S. in cyber war. That service was the first to create an organization for the purpose of combat in the
new domain: U.S. Air Force Cyber Command.
THE FIGHT FOR CYBER WAR
In October 2009, when the doors opened on the multiservice, joint U.S. Cyber Command, the Navy
had already followed the Air Force in standing up its own cyberwarfare unit. All the new organizations
and big pronouncements gave some the impression that the U.S. military was just getting interested in
cyber warfare, coming rather late to the game. Not so. The Department of Defense invented the Internet,
and the possibility of using it in warfare was not overlooked even in its early days. As highlighted above,
in chapter 1, early cyber warriors had a plan back in the first Gulf War to use cyber weapons to take
down Iraqâ s air defense system. Shortly after that war, the Air Force set up its Info War Center. In
1995, National Defense University graduated its first class of officers trained to lead cyber war
campaigns.
Some in the 1990s military did not fully understand what cyber war meant and thought of it as â  info
ops,â part of psychological warfare, or â  psyopsâ (using propaganda to influence the outcome of wars).
Others, particularly those in the intelligence branches, were seeing the ever expanding Internet as a
bonanza for electronic espionage. It started to become pretty obvious that once you had penetrated a
network to collect information, a few more keystrokes could take that network down.. As this realization
grew among the electronic intelligence officers, they had a dilemma. The intelligence guys knew that if
they told the â  operatorsâ (the fighting units) that the Internet was making a new kind of war possible, they
would lose some control of cyberspace to the â  warriors.â On the other hand, the warriors would still
have to rely on the intelligence geeks to do anything in cyberspace. Moreover, the opportunities
cyberspace offered to relatively easily do significant damage to an enemy were too good to pass up.
Slowly, the warriors realized that the geeks were on to something.
By the time George W. Bush was starting his second term, the importance of cyber war to the
Pentagon became apparent, as the Air Force, Navy, and intelligence agencies engaged in a bitter struggle
to see who would control this new area of warfare. Some advocated the creation of a Unified Command,
bringing the units of all three services under one integrated structure. There were already Unified
Commands for transportation, strategic nuclear war, and for each of the worldâ s regions. When it
appeared in the early 1980s that there would be a large role for the military in outer space, the Pentagon
created a Unified Command for what it then thought of as a new domain for war-fighting, a domain that
the United States had to control. U.S. Space Command lasted from 1985 to 2002, by which time it had
become clear that neither the U.S. nor any other government had the money to do much in space. Space
Page 22

Command was folded into Strategic Command (STRATCOM), which operates the strategic nuclear
forces. STRATCOM, headquartered at a bomber base in Nebraska, was also given the centralized
responsibility for cyber war in 2002. The Air Force, however, was set on running the actual war-fighting
units. The creation of Air Force Cyber Command and the standing given to cyberspace in the Air Force
recruitment ads jarred the other services and many in the Pentagon.
Some were concerned that the Air Force was talking too openly about something they believed should
have been kept secret: the mere existence of cyber war capability. Yet there was the civilian Air Force
Secretary (a vestigial post from the time before there was a strong civilian Defense Department) saying
publicly, â  Tell the nation the age of cyber war is here.â There were those damn ads, including one that
said, ominously, that in the future a blackout â  could be a cyber attack.â Another ad showed the Pentagon
and claimed that it was â  attackedâ millions of times a day in cyberspace, but it was defended by the likes
of an Air Force sergeant shown at his keyboard. There were persistent interviews and speeches by Air
Force leaders who sounded very aggressive about their intentions. â  Our mission is to control cyberspace,
both for attacks and defense,â Lieutenant General Robert Elder had admitted. The Director of the Air
Force Cyberspace Operations Task Force had been equally candid: â  If you are defending in cyberspace,
youâ re already too late. If you do not dominate in cyberspace, you cannot dominate in other domains. If
you are a developed country [and you are attacked in cyberspace], your life comes to a screeching halt.â
By 2008, those in the Pentagon not wearing blue uniforms had become persuaded about the
importance of cyber war, but they were also convinced that it should not just be conducted by the Air
Force. An integrated multiservice structure was agreed on in principle, but many were reluctant to â  make
the Space Command mistake again.â They did not want to create a Unified Command for what might
prove to be a passing fad, as war fighting in space had been. The compromise was that a multiservice
Cyber Command would be created, but it would remain subordinated to STRATCOM, at least on
paper. The Air Force would have to stop calling its organization a command and would instead have to
be satisfied with a â  numbered air force,â their basic organizational unit, like Navyâ s numbered fleets. The
agreement in principle did not resolve all of the major issues standing in the way of a new command.
The intelligence community had a view. Under the post-9/11 reorganization, there was now a single
person in charge of all eighteen U.S. intelligence agencies. In 2008, that man was Mike McConnell. He
looked much the part of what he had recently been, a well-to-do businessman often seen in the halls of
Wall Street financial institutions. He had come to the intelligence job from the global consulting giant Booz
Allen Hamilton. Slightly hunched over and wearing thick glasses, the soft-spoken McConnell had not
taken a traditional path to leadership at Booz. For most of his life, he had been in Navy intelligence,
retiring as a three-star (or vice) admiral, the man in charge of the worldâ s premier electronic intelligence
organization, the National Security Agency (NSA).
Hearing McConnell, or his successor, Air Force General Ken Minihan, talk about NSA even on an
unclassified basis, you begin to understand why they believe re-creating some of its capabilities elsewhere
is folly and perhaps impossible. They both speak with real reverence about the decades of experience
and expertise NSA has in â  doing the impossibleâ when it comes to electronic espionage. NSAâ s
involvement in the Internet grew out of its mission to listen to radio signals and telephone calls. The
Internet was just another electronic medium. As Internet usage grew, so did intelligence agenciesâ  interest
in it. Populated with Ph.D.s and electrical engineers, NSA quietly became the worldâ s leading center of
cyberspace expertise. Although not authorized to alter data or engage in disruption and damage, NSA
thoroughly infiltrated the Internet infrastructure outside of the U.S. to spy on foreign entities.
When McConnell left NSA in 1996 for Booz Allen Hamilton, he continued his focus on the Internet,
working with leading U.S. companies on their cyber security plans for over a decade. Returning to the
spook business in 2007, he tried, as the second-ever Director of National Intelligence, to assert authority
over all of the U.S. intelligence agencies, including CIA. In doing so, his longstanding friendship with CIA
Director Mike Hayden was damaged. Hayden had also once been Director of NSA, or as they say it in
the intelligence community DIRNSA (pronounced â  dern-sahâ). Hayden remained an active-duty
four-star Air Force General much of the time he ran CIA.
Because both Mikes (McConnell and Hayden) had the background of running NSA, they agreed on
Page 23
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
at least one thing: any new Cyber Command must not try to replicate the capabilities it had taken
decades to develop at NSA. If anything were to be done, they and many of the other NSA alumni
believed, NSA should just become the new Cyber Command. Their views mattered in the Pentagon,
since they were, or had been, senior military officers, and they actually knew something about
cyberspace. To counter the â  NSA takeoverâ of Cyber Command, some in the military argued that NSA
was really a civilian organization, an intelligence unit, and therefore could not legally fight wars. They
talked about â  Title 50 versus Title 10â authority, referring to the parts of the U.S. Code that give legal
authority and limitations to various government departments and agencies. Such laws can, of course, be
changed if they have outlived their utility. Nonetheless, the issue of who would run Americaâ s cyber wars
soon became a battle between military and civilian government lawyers.
In any other alignment of leaders, the outcome would likely have been decided in the militaryâ s favor
and some new organization would have been built from the ground up, replicating the hacking skills at
which NSA was the past master. In 2006, however, the turf-grabbing Secretary of Defense, Donald
Rumsfeld, had been replaced after devastating midterm election losses brought on in part by
mismanagement of the Iraq War. Rumsfeldâ s replacement was the president of Texas A&M University,
Robert Gates. At the time of his nomination I had known Bob for the better part of three decades and
expected that he would be an unusually good Secretary of Defense. He was not a Pentagon man, had not
grown up there. Nor was he a national security novice from industry or academia, the type easily
manipulated by experienced Pentagon hands. Bob had been a career CIA officer who worked his way
up to CIA Director, stopping off in the White House National Security Council along the way. Gates saw
the Cyber Command debate from an intelligence community perspective and, more important, from the
unique perch one has at the White House. When you are working directly for whoever the President may
be at the time, you suddenly realize that there is a national interest that surpasses the turf concerns of
whatever bureaucracy you may have come from. Gates had that broader view, and he was a pragmatist.
What resulted was a compromise in which the Director of NSA would become a four-star general (up
from three stars) and would also be the head of U.S. Cyber Command. The Pentagon calls having two
jobs being â  dual hatted.â For now, at least, Cyber Command would be a â  sub-Unified Commandâ under
STRATCOM. The assets of NSA would be available to support U.S. Cyber Command, thus obviating
the need for reinventing many wheels. The Air Force, Navy, and Army would continue to have cyber
war units, but they would be run by U.S. Cyber Command. Technically, it would be those war-fighting
military units that would actually engage in cyber combat and not the partially civilian intelligence agency
that is NSA. While NSA has a lot of expertise in network penetration, under U.S. law (Title 10) the
agency is restricted to collecting information and prohibited from war-fighting. Therefore it will have to be
military personnel under Title 50 that enter the keystrokes to take down enemy systems. To assist Cyber
Command in its defensive role of protecting Defense Department networks, the Pentagon would also
co-locate its own Internet service provider at Fort Meade, Maryland, alongside NSA. The Pentagonâ s
ISP is unlike any other, since it runs two of the largest networks in the world. Called the Defense
Information Systems Agency (DISA), it is run by a three-star general. Thus, ninety-two years after it
opened as an Army base, home to hundreds of horses, Fort Meade became the heart of Americaâ s
defensive and offensive cyber war forces. Defense contractors are building offices nearby in the hopes of
sharing in some of the billions of dollars that will be flowing to Fort Meade. Maryland-area universities
are already recipients of large research grants from the nearby military campus, referred to throughout
Washington simply as â  The Fort.â
As a result of the decision to create U.S. Cyber Command, what had been Air Force Cyber
Command became the 24th Air Force, with headquarters at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. This
numbered air force wonâ t have any aircraft. The mission of the 24th will be to provide â  combat-ready
forces trained and equipped to conduct sustained cyber operations, fully integrated within air and space
operations.â The 24th Air Force will have control of two existing â  wings,â the 688th Information
Operations Wing, formerly the Air Force Information Operations Center, and the 67th Network Warfare
Wing, as well as control of a new wing, the 689th Combat Communications Wing. The 688th IOW, as
the Information Operations Wing is known, will act as the Air Forceâ s â  center of excellenceâ in cyber
Page 24
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
operations. The 688th will be a forward-looking element with the mission of finding new ways to create
an advantage for the U.S. Air Force using cyber weapons. The 67th Wing will have the day-to-day
responsibility for defending Air Force networks and for attacking enemy networks. All totaled, the 24th
Air Force will comprise some 6,000 to 8,000 military and civilian cyber warriors.
In case the U.S. Air Force is ever given the order to do as one of its ads suggests (â  A power blackout
is just a blackout. But in the future, it could be a cyber attack.â), the mission will likely fall to the Fighting
67th. Their motto, from pre-cyber days as an aerial reconnaissance outfit, is Lux Ex Tenebris (Light from
Darkness). Perhaps they will soon modify it to Tenebra Ex Luce. Despite the demotion of their
command, the Air Force lost little of their zeal for cyber war. In the summer of 2009, the head of the
U.S. Air Force, General Norton Schwartz, wrote to his officers that â  cyberspace is vital to todayâ s fight
and to the future U.S. military advantage [and] it is the intent of the United States Air Force to provide a
full spectrum of cyberspace capabilities. Cyberspace is a contested domain, and the fight is onâ today.â
Not to be outdone, the U.S. Navy also reorganized. The Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Gary
Roughead (really), gave himself a new Deputy for Information Dominance. Itâ s not just Roughead and his
sailors who are into dominance; the U.S. military in general repeatedly characterizes cyberspace as
something to be dominated. It is reminiscent of the Pentagonâ s way of speaking of nuclear war in the
1960s. The historian of nuclear strategy Lawrence Freedman noted that William Kaufmann, Henry
Kissinger, and other strategists realized that there was a need then â  to calm the spirit of offense, potent in
Air Force circlesâ ¦[whose] rhetoric encouraged a view of war that was out-moded and dangerous.â
That same sort of macho rhetoric is strong in Air Force cyber war circles today, and apparently in the
Navy as well.
Admiral Roughead created not just a Dominance office on the Navy Staff, but a new â  war-fightingâ
command. The 5th Fleet sails the Arab Gulf, the 6th Fleet the Mediterranean, and the 7th the China Sea.
To fight cyber war, the U.S. Navy has reactivated its 10th Fleet. Originally, a small organization during
World War II that coordinated antisubmarine warfare in the Atlantic, the 10th Fleet was disbanded
shortly after victory over Germany in 1945. Then as now, the 10th Fleet was a â  paperâ or â  phantomâ
fleet that had no ships. It was a land-based organization that filled a necessary coordinating role. Modest
in scope and scale, the 10th Fleet in World War II served its limited purpose well with no more than fifty
intelligence officers. This time, the Navy has much more ambitious plans for the 10th Fleet. The existing
Naval Network Warfare Command, known as NETWARCOM, will continue its operational
responsibilities subordinated to the 10th Fleet. Although the Navy has not done the sort of public
self-promotion of its cyber warriors that the Air Force has, they insist that they have as much tech savvy
as â  the fly boys.â Perhaps to prove that point, one Naval officer told me, â  You know, the 10th Fleet
took a pretty bad licking from the Cardassians in 2374,â thus proving that the current U.S. Navy at least
has Trekkies, if perhaps not as many geeks as the Air Force.
For its part, the Armyâ s cyber warriors are mostly contained in the Network Enterprise Technology
Command, the 9th Signal Command at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. Members of this unit are assigned to the
signal commands in each geographic region of the world. Network warfare units, what the Army calls
NetWar units, under the Armyâ s Intelligence and Security Command, are also forward-deployed to
support combat operations alongside traditional intelligence units. They work closely with NSA to deliver
intelligence to war fighters on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army Global Network Operations
and Security Center, known by the awkward acronym A-GNOSC, manages LandWarNet, which is
what the Army calls its portion of the Department of Defenseâ s networks. In July 2008, the Army stood
up its first NetWar Battalion. If the Army sounds like the least organized of the services to fight cyber
war, that is because it is. After the decision to create Cyber Command was made, the Secretary of
Defense mandated the creation of an Army task force to review the Armyâ s cyber mission and
organization to support that mission.
While most people who followed the fight over cyber war in the Pentagon thought NSA won it, former
NSA Director Ken Minihan was not satisfied, and that gave me pause. Ken is a friend whom I have
known since, as an Air Force three-star general, he took over NSA in 1996. He believes that NSA and
the U.S. militaryâ s approach to cyber operations needs to be rethought. The Navy, he thinks, is focused
Page 25
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
only on other navies. The Air Force is focused on air defense. The Army is hopelessly lost, and the NSA
remains at heart an intelligence collection agency. â  Not one of these entities is sufficiently focused on
foreign counterintelligence in cyberspace, or on gaining hold of foreign critical infrastructure that the U.S.
may want to take down without dropping a bomb in the next conflict.â He believes that cyber war
planning today lacks a â  requirements process,â a national-level planning system to get NSA and other
organizations working on the same page. â  Right now, they are all focused on doing what they want to do,
not what a President may need them to be able to do.â
Minihan and McConnell are both concerned that U.S. Cyber Command cannot defend the United
States. â  All the offensive cyber capability the U.S. can muster wonâ t matter if no one is defending the
nation from cyber attack,â said McConnell. Cyber Commandâ s mission is to defend DoD and maybe
some other government agencies, but there are no plans or capabilities for it to defend the civilian
infrastructure. Both former NSA Directors believe that mission should be handled by the Department of
Homeland Security, as in the existing plans; but both men contend that Homeland has no current ability to
defend the corporate cyberspace that makes most of the country work. Neither does the Pentagon. As
Minihan put it, â  Though it is called the â Defenseâ  Department, if called on to defend the U.S. homeland
from a cyber attack carried out by a foreign power, your half-trillion-dollar-a-year Defense Department
would be useless.â
THE SECRET ATTEMPT AT A STRATEGY
The perception that cyberspace is a â  domainâ where fighting takes place, a domain that the U.S. must
â  dominate,â pervades American military thinking on the subject of cyber war. The secret-level National
Military Strategy for Cyber Operations (partially declassified as a result of a Freedom of Information Act
request) reveals the militaryâ s attitude toward cyber war, in part because it was written as a document
that we, the citizens, were never supposed to see. It is how they talk about it behind the closed doors of
the Pentagon. What is striking in the document is not only the acknowledgment that cyber war is real, but
the almost reverential way in which it is discussed as the keystone holding up the edifice of modern
war-fighting capability. Because there are so few opportunities to hear from the U.S. military on cyber
war strategy, it is worth reading closely the secret-level attempt at a cyber war strategy.
The document, signed out under a cover letter from the Secretary of Defense, declares that the goal is
â  to ensure the US military [has] strategic superiority in cyberspace.â Such superiority is needed to
guarantee â  freedom of actionâ for the American military and to â  deny the same to our adversaries.â To
obtain superiority, the U.S. must attack, the strategy declares. â  Offensive capabilities in cyberspace [are
needed] to gain and maintain the initiative.â At first read, the strategy sounds like a mission statement with
a bit of zealotry thrown in. On closer examination, however, the strategy reflects an understanding of
some of the key problems created by cyber war. Speaking to the geography of cyberspace, the strategy
implicitly acknowledges the sovereignty issue (â  the lack of geopolitical boundariesâ ¦allows cyberspace
operations to occur nearly anywhereâ) as well as the presence of civilian targets (â  cyberspace reaches
across geopolitical boundariesâ ¦and is tightly integrated into the operations of critical infrastructure and
the conduct of commerceâ). It does not, however, suggest that such civilian targets should be off-limits
from U.S. attacks. When it comes to defending U.S. civilian targets, the strategy passes the buck to the
Department of Homeland Security.
The need to take the initiative, to go first, is dictated in part by the fact that actions taken in cyberspace
move at a pace never before experienced in war (â  cyberspace allows high rates of operational
maneuverâ ¦at speeds that approach the speed of lightâ ¦. [It] affords commanders opportunities to
deliver effects at speeds that were previously incomprehensibleâ). Moreover, the strategy notes that if
you do not act quickly, you may not be able to do so because â  a previously vulnerable target may be
replaced or provided with new defenses with no warning, rendering cyberspace operations less
effective.â In short, if you wait for the other side to attack you in cyberspace, you may find that the
opponent has, simultaneously with their attack, removed your logic bombs or disconnected the targets
from the network paths you expected to use to access them. The strategy does not discuss the problems
associated with going first or the pressure to do so.
Page 26
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
The importance of cyberspace and cyber war to the U.S. military is revealed in the strategyâ s
declaration that â  DOD will conduct kinetic missions to preserve freedom of action and strategic
advantage in cyberspace.â Translated from Pentagonese, that statement means that rather than cyber
attacks being just some support mechanism of a shooting war, the Defense Department envisions the
need to bomb things in the physical world to defend against cyber attack, or to drive an enemy into
networks that American cyber warriors control.
The strategic concept of deterrence is discussed in the strategy only insofar as it envisions a desired
end state where â  adversaries are deterred from establishing or employing offensive capabilities against
US interests in cyberspace.â Since twenty or thirty nations have already established offensive cyber units,
we apparantly did not deter them from â  establishing.â The way to stop those nations from using that
capability against us, however, is discussed as â  inducing adversary restraint based on demonstrated
capabilities.â However, the secrecy surrounding U.S. offensive cyber war weapons means that we have
no demonstrated capabilities. By the logic of the U.S. militaryâ s strategy, we therefore cannot induce
adversary restraint. The strategy does not suggest a way around this conundrum, let alone recognize it.
Thus, what is called a military strategy for cyber operations raises some of the key issues that would need
to be addressed in a strategy, but it does not provide answers. It is not really a strategy, but more of an
appreciation. To the extent that it provides guidance, it seems to argue for initiating combat in cyberspace
before the other side does, and for doing all that may be needed to dominate in cyberspace, because to
do otherwise would put other kinds of American dominance at risk.
Buried in the document is, however, a realistic assessment of the problems facing the U.S. in cyber
war: â  threat actors can take advantage of [our] dependenceâ on cyberspace; and, â  absent significant
effort, the US will not continue to possess an advantage in cyberspaceâ and the U.S. will â  risk parity with
adversaries.â Put another way, the strategy does note the fact that other nations may be able to inflict
cyber war damage on us equal to our ability to inflict it on them. It may actually be worse, because we
have a greater dependence on cyberspace, which can play to the advantage of an attacker.
If the U.S. is so vulnerable, to whom is it vulnerable? Who are the other cyber warriors?
WAKE-UP CALL FROM KUWAIT
It may have been the first Gulf War that convinced the generals of Chinaâ s Peopleâ s Liberation Army
(PLA) that they needed a special advantage, an asymmetrical technical capability against the United
States.
It was the first real war the U.S. had fought since Vietnam. In the decades before the 1990â 91 Gulf
War, the U.S. military had been relatively constrained abroad, by the continued presence of the Soviet
Union and its nuclear arsenal. The invasions of Grenada by President Reagan and Panama by the first
President Bush had been small engagements in our own backyard, and yet they had not gone terribly
well. In those conflicts, U.S. military operations still showed the kind of dysfunction and poor
coordination that marked the failed Desert One Mission in Iran in 1979 and helped to end the presidency
of Jimmy Carter. Then came Desert Storm. President George H. W. Bush and his cabinet assembled the
largest coalition since World War II. More than thirty nations coalesced against Saddam Hussein,
bringing together more than 4,000 aircraft, 12,000 tanks, and nearly 2 million military personnel, all paid
for by donations from Japan, Germany, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. The war was to mark a new era in
international relations, what General Brent Scowcroft, President Bushâ s National Security Advisor, went
so far as to call a â  new world order.â In it, the sovereignty of all nations would be respected and the
mission of the United Nations would finally be fulfilled, now that the Soviet Union was no longer in a
position to check such actions. Desert Storm was also the dawn of a new kind of warfare, dominated by
the computer and other high technology to manage logistics and provide near-realtime intelligence. The
Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, an American industry group, publicly
documented just how dramatically the use of computer networks changed that war in its 1992 book, The
First Information War.
While General Norman Schwarzkopf and the other military brass may not have been ready to use
cyber weapons to take down the Iraqi air defense network, they were ready to embrace computer
Page 27
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
networks to target the enemy. The war fighters also loved the new breed of â  smart weaponsâ that
information systems technology made possible. Designed to replace traditional bombs that required many
missions and many tons of munitions dropped to destroy a target, â  smart bombsâ were designed to put
one bomb, and one bomb only, precisely on each target every time. They would greatly reduce the
number of missions that needed to be flown and promised to nearly eliminate civilian collateral-damage
casualties.
Of course, the â  smart weaponsâ of 1991 were not so smart, and there were not too many of them. In
the 1996 movie Wag the Dog, a fictional political operative named Conrad â  Connieâ Brean, played by
Robert De Niro, claims that the famous missile down a chimney was done in a studio in Hollywood.
â  Whatâ s the thing people remember about the Gulf War?â Brean asks. â  A bomb falling down a chimney.
Let me tell you something: I was in the building where we filmed that with a ten-inch model made out of
Legos.â What De Niroâ s character claimed wasnâ t true, but the smart bombs of 1991 were overhyped.
While the video was real, the tightly controlled media did not seem to realize that most of the bombs
dropped were not precision munitions guided by lasers and satellites but â  dumbâ bombs, dropped in the
thousands by B-52s. The smart bombs then were unreliable and in short supply, but they showed the
direction that warfare was moving in, and they showed the Chinese that they were decades behind.
As Desert Storm unfolded, Americans sat glued to their TVs, watching those grainy videos of bombs
being dropped down smokestacks. They cheered the renewed prowess of the once-again formidable
American military. Saddam Husseinâ s army was the fourth-largest in the world. His weapons, largely of
Soviet make and design, the same as Chinaâ s arsenal, were mostly destroyed from the air before they
could ever be used. The U.S. ground war lasted one hundred hours, following thirty-eight days of air
strikes. Among those watching on television were the leaders of the Chinese military. The former Director
of National Intelligence, Admiral Mike McConnell, believes that â  the Chinese received a big shock when
watching the action of Desert Storm.â Later they probably read The First Information War and other
accounts and realized how far behind they really were. They soon began referring to the Gulf War as 
zhongda biange, â  the great transformation.â
For a period of several years in the mid-1990s the Chinese talked very openly, for a Communist
police state, about what they had learned from the Gulf War. They noted that their strategy had been to
defeat the U.S. by overwhelming numbers if a war ever happened. Now they concluded that that strategy
would not work. They began to downsize their military and invest in new technologies. One of those
technologies was wangluohua, â  networkization,â to deal with the â  new battlefield of computers.â What
they talked about publicly then sounds strikingly similar to what the U.S. Air Force generals were saying.
Writing in his militaryâ s daily paper, one Chinese expert explained that â  the enemy country can receive a
paralyzing blow through the Internet.â A senior colonel, perhaps thinking of the U.S. and China, wrote
that â  a superior force that loses information dominance will be beaten, while an inferior one that seizes
information dominance will be able to win.â Major General Wang Pufeng, head of strategy at the military
academy, wrote openly of the goal of zhixinxiquan, â  information dominance.â Major General Dai
Qingmin of the General Staff stated that such dominance could only be achieved by preemptive cyber
attack. These strategists created â  Integrated Network Electronic Warfare,â something similar to the
Netcentric Warfare fad that was sweeping the Pentagon.
By the end of the 1990s, Chinaâ s strategists had converged on the idea that cyber warfare could be
used by China to make up for its qualitative military deficiencies when compared to the United States.
Admiral McConnell believes that â  the Chinese concluded from the Desert Storm experience that their
counter approach had to be to challenge Americaâ s control of the battlespace by building capabilities to
knock out our satellites and invade our cyber networks. In the name of the defense of China in this new
world, the Chinese feel they have to remove that advantage of the U.S. in the event of a war.â
A recurring word in these Chinese statements was â  asymmetryâ likewise, the phrase â  asymmetric
warfare.â Much of what we know about Chinaâ s asymmetric warfare doctrine is contained in a slim
volume translated as Unrestricted Warfare. The book, written by two high-ranking Chinese army
colonels, was first published in 1999. It provides a blueprint for how weaker countries can outmaneuver
status quo powers using weapons and tactics that fall outside the traditional military spectrum. The
Page 28
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
publishers of the most widely available English translation view the book as â  Chinaâ s master plan to
destroy America,â a subtitle the Americans added to the front cover of the U.S. edition. And in case the
reader misses the point, the cover shows the World Trade Center engulfed in flames. A quote on the
back, from a right-wing lunatic, claims that the book â  is evidence linking China to 9-11.â Despite the
right-wing rhetoric surrounding the U.S. edition, the book is one of the best windows through which we
can understand Chinese military thinking on cyber war.
The book advocates tactics that have become known as shashoujian, the â  assassinâ s mace,â meant
to take advantage of weaknesses created by an adversaryâ s seemingly superior conventional capabilities.
The goal of the strategy is â  fighting the fight that fits oneâ s weaponsâ and â  making the weapons to fit the
fight.â It proposes a strategy of ignoring the traditional rules of conflict, including, at its extreme, the
prohibition on targeting civilians. It also advocates manipulating foreign media, flooding enemy countries
with drugs, controlling the markets for natural resources, and joining international legal bodies in order to
bend them to oneâ s will. For a book written a decade ago, it also places a heavy emphasis on cyber war.
This possible use of cyber war against a superior force does not mean that China is in fact intent on
fighting the U.S., just that its military planners recognize that war with the U.S. is a contingency for which
they must plan. The Chinese government has adopted the phrase â  peacefully risingâ to describe the
countryâ s projected emergence as a (if not the) global superpower in the twenty-first century. Yet
Admiral Mike McConnell believes that â  the Chinese are exploiting our systems for information
advantage, looking for the characteristics of a weapons system or academic research on plasma physics.â
Chinaâ s rapid economic growth and dependence upon global resources, as well as its disputes with its
neighbors (Taiwan, Vietnam), probably suggest to its military, however, that they have to be ready for
possible conflict someday. And they are getting ready.
To the head of the U.S. military, Admiral Mike Mullen (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), it all
looks like it is aimed squarely at the United States. â  [China is] developing capabilities that are very
maritime focused, maritime and air focused, and in many ways, very much focused on us,â he said in a
speech at the Navy League in May of 2009. â  They seem very focused on the United States Navy and
our bases that are in that part of the world,â he continued. The 2009 update of the annual report from the
Office of the Secretary of Defense on the â  Military Power of the Peopleâ s Republic of Chinaâ supports
these claims. The Chinese have developed long-range radar that can see past our air base on Guam.
They have developed antiship missiles that close so fast that none of our defense systems could intercept
them. China has purchased one Russian Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier and is currently in the process of
refurbishing it at Dalian shipyard. They will soon have the capability to start constructing new carriers and
have put in place a training program so that pilots will be qualified for carrier operations. They have
strung over 2,000 missiles along the coast facing Taiwan and are adding more at the rate of 100 per year.
They are close to deploying a missile with a 5,000-mile range that could give them a sea-based nuclear
strike capability.
It all sounds a bit scary, but look closer and you will see evidence that the modernization alone is
insufficient to counter U.S. conventional force superiority. Chinaâ s military budget is just a fraction of
Americaâ s. Allegedly only $70 billion, it is less than one-eighth of the Pentagonâ s budget before adding in
the costs of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. A U.S. carrier strike group is one of the most powerful
conventional forces ever assembled. Consisting of up to a dozen ships, including guided-missile cruisers,
destroyers, frigates, submarines, and supply ships, a carrier strike group can cover over 700 nautical
miles in a single day, which allows it to go anywhere there is ocean within two weeks. The U.S. Navy
boasts eleven carrier battle groups. To keep that force modern, the Navy is in the process of constructing
three next-generation Ford-class carriers, with the first carrier set to be launched in 2015.
The Pentagonâ s annual assessment, Military Power of the Peopleâ s Republic of China, for 2009
estimates that the former Russian aircraft carrier will not be operational before 2015. The consensus view
in the U.S. intelligence community is that China is at least a decade away from being able to marshal a
modern fighting force that is capable of convincingly defeating even a moderate-sized enemy like
Vietnam. Not until 2015 will China be able to project significant power off of its shores, and only then in
limited cases against an opponent less capable than the U.S. is now. Unless.
Page 29
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Unlessâ ¦they can even things up by using cyber war against such things as U.S. carriers. The Chinese
were always impressed by U.S. carriers, but their attention was heightened in 1996, when President Bill
Clinton sent two U.S. carrier battle groups to protect Taiwan during one particularly nasty exchange of
tough rhetoric between Beijing and Taipei. So the Chinese military followed its new strategy and
developed a â  virtual roadmapâ for how to take down an aircraft carrier battle group in a paper titled
â  Tactical Data Links in Information Warfare.â This unclassified paper, written by two Chinese Air Force
officers, relies on open source material, most of which can be pulled off the web, to illustrate how the
information systems that the U.S. military relies on can be jammed or disrupted using relatively low-tech
means.
These are the kinds of tactics that Unrestricted Warfareâ s strategy articulates. The book
recommends a program to steal a potential enemyâ s technology, find flaws in it to exploit, and develop
oneâ s own version as part of a program to create a modernized and smaller force. Not lost on Chinese
military strategists, however, is the abililty of cyber weapons to skip the battlefield altogether. China has
prepared in the event of war to inflict damage on the enemyâ s home front, not with conventional
weapons, but asymmetrically, through cyber attack. The two paths of improvement only make sense
together. Even with the significant modernization of equipment, China will not be the equal of the U.S.
military for many decades. However, if China can use asymmetrical tactics like cyber war, it believes the
new, modern Chinese forces would be sufficiently advanced to take on U.S. forces that will have been
crippled by Chinese cyber attack. Recently, Pentagon planners have had a scare put into them by an
article in Orbis titled â  How the United States Lost the Naval War of 2015.â In it, James Kraska paints a
vivid picture of how in the near future China could take on the United States Navy and win.
THE EAST IS GEEK
From what we know of Chinaâ s cyber warfare capabilities and the espionage campaigns the Chinese
have carried out, that two-pronged approach is exactly what the Chinese have undertaken. Since the late
1990s, China has systematically done all the things a nation would do if it contemplated having an
offensive cyber war capability and also thought that it might itself be targeted by cyber war; it has
ï· created citizen hacker groups,
ï· engaged in extensive cyber espionage, including of U.S. computer software and
hardware,
ï· taken several steps to defend its own cyberspace,
ï· established cyber war military units, and
ï· laced U.S. infrastructure with logic bombs.
While developing cyber strategy, China also made use of private hackers closely aligned with
the stateâ s interests. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission estimates that
there are up to 250 groups of hackers in China that are sophisticated enough to pose a threat to
U.S. interests in cyberspace. We saw something of their early capabilities in 1999, when the
United States led a NATO air campaign to stop the slaughter in Kosovo by Serbian forces. The
U.S. had all but perfected its smart weapons and used them to eliminate the Serbiansâ  Soviet-era
military apparatus without losing a single American life (one U.S. warplane went down due to
mechanical failure). Unfortunately, smart weapons canâ t make up for bad intelligence. Six bombs
dropped from U.S. aircraft hit the precise coordinates provided to the mission planners by the
CIA. The target was supposed to be the Yugoslav Federal Directorate for Supply and
Procurement, a planning agency of the Serbian military. The coordinates, however, were about
900 feet off from the Directorate and exactly on top of the Chinese embassy.
The Chinese held protests outside U.S. embassies and consulates, issued condemnatory
statements within the UN and other bodies, and demanded compensation for the victims and
their families. After the embassy bombing, U.S. and NATO websites were targeted with denial
of service attacks. Government agencies had their in-boxes stuffed with spam messages
protesting the bombing. Some NATO webpages were forced down, while others were defaced.
The attacks did little damage to U.S. military or government operations. The effort amounted to
Page 30
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
little more than what we call â  hacktivismâ today, a fairly mild form of online protest. It was,
however, a first use of cyberspace by China to protest. Chinese hacktivists did it again in 2001,
when a U.S. â  spy planeâ allegedly entered Chinese airspace and was forced by Chinese fighter
jets to land in China. However, while these Chinese citizen hackers were launching their primitive
denial of service and spam attacks, Chinaâ s intelligence-industry partnership was also busy.
The Chinese government went after two underpinnings of the U.S. computer industryâ s
dominance of networking technology, Microsoft and Cisco. By threatening to ban Chinese
government procurement from Microsoft, Beijing persuaded Bill Gates to provide China with a
copy of its secret operating system code. Microsoft had refused to show that same code to its
largest U.S. commercial customers. Then China copied the Cisco network router found on
almost all U.S. networks and at most Internet service providers. Cisco had a manufacturing plant
for the routers in China. Chinese companies then sold counterfeit Cisco routers at cut-rate
discounts around the world. The buyers allegedly included the Pentagon and other federal
government entities. Counterfeit routers started showing up on the market in 2004. Three years
later, the FBI and the Justice Department indicted two brothers who owned a company called
Syren Technology for selling the counterfeit routers to a customer list that included the Marine
Corps, the Air Force, and multiple defense contractors. A fifty-page report authored by the FBI
and circulated within the technology industry concluded that the routers could be used by foreign
intelligence agencies to take down networks and â  weaken cryptographic systems.â Meanwhile,
another Chinese company, Huawei, was selling similar routers throughout Europe and Asia. The
major difference was that, unlike the counterfeits, these routers did not say Cisco on the front.
Their label said Huawei.
With intimate knowledge of the flaws in Microsoft and Cisco software and hardware, Chinaâ s
hackers could stop most networks from operating. But wouldnâ t the Chinese be vulnerable, too?
They would be, if they used the same Microsoft and Cisco products we do. As part of the deal
with Microsoft, the Chinese modified the version sold in their country to introduce a secure
component using their own encryption. Hedging their bets, they also developed their own
operating system, called Kylin, modeled on the stable open source system known as Free BSD.
Kylin was approved by the Peopleâ s Liberation Army for use on their systems. China allegedly
also developed its own secure microprocessor for use on servers and Huawei routers. The
Chinese government is trying to install â  Green Dam Youth Escortâ software on all of its
computers, allegedly to screen for child pornography and other prohibited material. If they get it
to work, and proliferate it on all their systems, Green Dam could also scan for malware installed
by enemy states.
In addition to Green Dam, there is the system that U.S. wags call the Great Firewall of China.
Not really a firewall, the government-run system screens traffic on ISPs for subversive material,
such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The system engages in something called
â  Domain Name System hijacking,â sending you to a Chinese government clone of a real site
when you are in China and try to go, for example, to the webpage of a Christian evangelical
organization. It also has the ability to disconnect all Chinese networks from the rest of the global
Internet, something that would be handy to have if you thought the U.S. was about to launch a
cyber war attack on you. James Mulvenon, one of the leading American experts on Chinaâ s
cyber war capabilities, says that taken together, Green Dam, the Great Firewall, and other
systems represent â  a substantial investment by Chinese authorities in enhanced blocking, filtering,
and monitoringâ of their own cyberspace.
By 2003, China had announced the creation of cyber warfare units. Housed at the naval base
on Hainan Island are the Third Technical Department of the PLA and the Lingshui Signals
Intelligence Facility. According to the Pentagon, these units are responsible for offense and
defense in cyberspace, and have designed cyber weapons that have never been seen before and
that no defenses have been designed to stop. In one publication, the Chinese listed ten examples
of such weapons and techniques:
Page 31
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
ï· planting information mines
ï· conducting information reconnaissance
ï· changing network data
ï· releasing information bombs
ï· dumping information garbage
ï· disseminating propaganda
ï· applying information deception
ï· releasing clone (sic) information
ï· organizing information defense
ï· establishing network spy stations
China did establish two â  network spy stations,â not far from the U.S., in Cuba. With
the permission of the Castro government, the Chinese military created a facility to
monitor U.S. Internet traffic and another to monitor DoD communications. At about the
same time China announced the creation of its cyber warfare units, the U.S. experienced
one of the worst episodes of cyber espionage to date. Known as Titan Rain, the U.S.
code name given to the case, the incident involved the extraction of between 10 and 20
terabytes of data off the Pentagonâ s unclassified network. The hackers also targeted the
defense contractor Lockheed Martin, other military sites, and, for reasons that remain
hard to fathom, the World Bank. Vulnerabilities in Pentagon and other targeted networks
were systematically identified and then exploited to extract information through servers in
South Korea and Hong Kong. Investigators were able to trace the flow from these
intermediate servers back to a final server in Guangdong, China. U.S. Air Force Major
General William Lord directly and publicly attributed the attacks not to Chinese
hacktivists, but to the Chinese government.
By 2007, the Chinese government seemed to be involved in a widespread series of
penetrations of U.S. and European networks, successfully copying and exporting huge
volumes of data. The Director of the British domestic intelligence service MI5, Jonathan
Evans, wrote letters to 300 leading companies in the U.K., advising them that their
networks had probably been penetrated by the Chinese government. Evansâ s
counterpart in Germany, Hans Remberg, also accused the Beijing government, this time
of hacking into the computer of Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor.
The computer espionage also went after a high-ranking American, hacking into the
computer of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Later, Chinese operatives copied
information off of U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrezâ s laptop when he
visited Beijing, then attempted to use that information to gain access to Commerce
Department computers. Commenting on the Chinese, Gatesâ s Deputy Undersecretary,
Robert Lawless, admitted that they have â  a very sophisticated capability to attack and
degrade our computer systemsâ ¦to shut down our critical systems. They see it as a
major component of their asymmetrical warfare capability.â
In 2009, Canadian researchers uncovered a highly sophisticated computer program
they dubbed GhostNet. It had taken over an estimated 1,300 computers at several
countriesâ  embassies around the world. The program had the capability to remotely turn
on a computerâ s camera and microphone without alerting the user and to export the
images and sound silently back to servers in China. A top target of the program were
offices related to nongovernmental organizations working on Tibetan issues. The
operation ran for twenty-two months until discovered. The same year, U.S. intelligence
leaked to the media that Chinese hackers had penetrated the U.S. power grid and left
behind tools that could be used to bring the grid down.
The extent of Chinese government hacking against U.S., European, and Japanese
industries and research facilities is without precedent in the history of espionage.
Exabytes of data have been copied from universities, industrial labs, and government
Page 32
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
facilities. The secrets behind everything from pharmaceutical formulas to bioengineering
designs, to nanotechnology, to weapons systems, to everyday industrial products have
been taken by the Peopleâ s Liberation Army and by private hacking groups and given to
China, Inc.
In the latest incident to become public, Google revealed its discovery of a highly
sophisticated campaign targeting both the companyâ s intellectual property and the e-mail
accounts of leaders in the Chinese dissident movement.
The hackers used advance â  spear-phishingâ techniques to dupe senior Google
executives into visiting websites where malware would automatically be downloaded
onto their computers to give the hackers root access. While most phishing scams cast a
wide net and try to catch a few peope who are gullible enough to fall for Nigerian
scammer e-mails, spear-phishing specifically targets an individual, figures out who their
acquaintances are on Facebook or Linked-in, and then tailors a message to look like it is
from someone they would trust. If you were a senior research scientist at Google, you
might have received an e-mail containing a link to a website that looked like it was from a
colleague. The message might have said, â  Hey, Chuck, I think this story will interest
youâ ¦â and then provided a link to fairly innocuous site. When the target clicked on the
link and visited the site, the hackers used a zero-day flaw in Internet Explorer, one that
was not publicly known and had yet to be patched, to download the malware silently and
in such a fashion that no antivirus software or other measures would detect it. The
malware created a back door to the computer so the hackers could maintain their access
and used the first compromised computer to work their way across the corporate
network until they reached the servers containing the source code, the crown jewel of a
software company.
When Googleâ s scientists figured out what was going on in mid-December, they
traced back the hacking to a server in Taiwan, where they found copies of their
proprietary information and those of at least twenty other companies, including Adobe,
Dow Chemical, and the defense contractor Northrop Grumman. From there, they traced
the attacks back to Mainland China, and then went to the FBI, making their public
announcement of the hacking and plans to exit the Chinese market in mid-January.
Some will suggest that war with China is, in any event, unlikely. Chinaâ s dependence
on U.S. markets for its manufactured goods and the trillions the country has invested in
U.S. Treasury bills mean that China would have a lot to lose in a war. One Pentagon
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity isnâ t so sure. He points out that the
economic meltdown in the U.S. has had a secondary effect in China that has put millions
of Chinese factory workers out on the streets. The Chinese government has not shown
the kind of concern that we expect in the West and is not apparently worried about any
weakening of its grip on the Chinese people. The lesson the Pentagon official takes away
is that China can take economic lumps and may well do so if the gains from warfare are
perceived as high enough.
What might such gains be? The trite answer one often hears is that China may find
itself forced to stop Taiwan from implementing a declaration of independence. When
serious analysts weigh the prospects of open conflict with China, however, they see it
playing out over the open waters of the South China Sea. The Spratly Islands are not
exactly a tourist destination. They are not exactly islands. If all were piled up together, the
reefs, sandbars, and rocks in the South China Sea would amount to less than two square
miles of land. That two square miles of land is spread out over more than 150,000
square miles of ocean. Itâ s not the islands that China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, the
Philippines, and Brunei are feuding over, but what is under them and around them. The
reefs have some of the largest remaining stocks of fish in the world, a resource not to be
discounted among the growing and hungry nations that lay claim to the waters. The
Page 33
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
islands also skirt the critical trade route that links the Indian Ocean to the Pacific nations
through which a large majority of the worldâ s oil flows out of the Middle East. Then there
are the Spratlysâ  oil and gas. Undeveloped fields estimated to hold more natural gas than
are Kuwait, currently home to the fourth-largest reserves in the world, could fuel the
economies of any of the countries for decades to come. Oil fields in the islands are
already well developed, often with platforms established by several nations drawing out
of the same reservoir.
If China decides to flex its newly developed military muscle, it may very well be in an
attempt to wrest these islands from its neighbors, a scenario explored as a tabletop
exercise later in the book. If China does seize the islands, the U.S. could, though
reluctantly, be drawn into a response. The U.S. has established security guarantees with
both the Philippines and Taiwan. Chevron has helped Vietnam develop the offshore oil
fields that that nation claims.
Alternatively, we might be deterred from intervening against China in the Pacific Rim if
the costs of doing so would be significant damage or disruption at home. According to
Defense Secretary Robert Gates, cyber attacks â  could threaten the United Statesâ 
primary means to project its power and help its allies in the Pacific.â Is that enough to
deter the U.S. from a confrontation with China? If the possibility of China crippling our
force projection capability is not enough to deter us, maybe the realization of our
domestic vulnerabilities to cyber attack would be. The alleged emplacement of logic
bombs in our electric grid may have been done in such a way that we would notice. One
former government official told us that he suspects the Chinese wanted us to know that if
we intervened in a Chinese conflict with Taiwan, the U.S. power grid would likely
collapse. â  They want to deter the United States from getting involved militarily within their
sphere of influence.â
The problem is, however, that deterrence only works if the other side is listening. U.S.
leaders may not have heard, or fully understood, what Beijing was trying to say. The
U.S. has done little or nothing to fix the vulnerabilities in its power grid or in other civilian
networks.
A SCORE OF OTHERS
I focused on China because its cyber war development has been, oddly, somewhat
transparent. U.S. intelligence officials do not, however, rate China as the biggest threat to
the U.S. in cyberspace. â  The Russians are definitely better, almost as good as we are,â
said one. There seems to be a consensus that China gets more attention because,
intentionally or otherwise, it has often left a trail of bread crumbs that can be followed
back to Tiananmen Square.
The Russian nongovernmental hackers, including large cyber criminal enterprises, are a
real force in cyberspace, as was demonstrated in the attacks on Estonia and Georgia
discussed in chapter 1. The hacktivists and criminals are generally thought to be
sanctioned by what used to be called the Sixteenth Directorate, a part of the infamous
Soviet intelligence apparatus known as the KGB. Later it was called FAPSI. Few
American intelligence officers could ever remember what FAPSI stood for (itâ s the
Russian acronym for: Federal Commission for Government Communications and
Information), they just knew it was â  Moscowâ s NSA.â
Like Americaâ s NSA, FAPSI started out doing code making and breaking, radio
intercept, bugging, and wiretapping. As soon as the Internet appeared, however, FAPSI
was on to it, taking over the largest ISP in Russia, later requiring all Russian ISPs to
install monitoring systems that only FAPSI could access. Of course, during the rise of the
Internet, the Soviet Union ended, and so, theoretically, did the KGB and FAPSI. In fact,
the organizations merely put up their headquarters with new names. After several
Page 34
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
changes, in 2003 FAPSI became the Service of Special Communications and
Information. Not all of their placarded buildings are in Moscow. In the southern city of
Voronezh, FAPSI, as many Russians still call it, runs what might be the largest (and
certainly one of the best) hacker schools in the world. By now, of course, they are
probably calling themselves cyber warriors.
Other nations known to have skilled cyber war units are Israel and France. U.S.
intelligence officials have suggested that there are twenty to thirty militaries with
respectable cyber war capability, including those of Taiwan, Iran, Australia, South
Korea, India, Pakistan, and several NATO states. â  The vast majority of the industrialized
countries in the world today have cyber-attack capabilities,â said former Director of
National Intelligence Admiral Mike McConnell.
WHEN CYBER WARRIORS ATTACK
You may by now believe that there are cyber warriors, but in addition to jamming
Internet sites what can they do, really? Obviously, we have not had a full-scale cyber war
yet, but we have a good idea what it would look like if we were on the receiving end.
Imagine a day in the near future. You are the Assistant to the President for Homeland
Security and you get a call from the White House Situation Room as you are packing up
to leave the office for the day, at eight p.m. NSA has issued a â  CRITICâ message, a rare
alert that something important has just happened. The one-line message says only: â  large
scale movement of several different zero day malware programs moving on Internet in the
US, affecting critical infrastructure.â The Situation Roomâ s Senior Duty Officer suggests
that you come down and help him figure out what is going on.
By the time you get to the Situation Room, the Director of the Defense Information
Systems Agency is waiting on the secure phone for you. He has just briefed the
Secretary of Defense, who suggested he call you. The unclassified Department of
Defense network known as the NIPRNET is collapsing. Large-scale routers throughout
the network are failing, and constantly rebooting. Network traffic is essentially halted. As
he is telling you this, you can hear someone in the background trying to get his attention.
When the general comes back on the line, he says softly and without emotion, â  Now itâ s
happening on the SIPRNET and JWICS, too.â He means that DoDâ s classified
networks are grinding to a halt.
Unaware of what is happening across the river at the Pentagon, the Undersecretary of
Homeland Security has called the White House, urgently needing to speak to you.
FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has told him that two of its
regional offices, in Philadelphia and in Denton, Texas, have reported large refinery fires
and explosions in Philadelphia and Houston, as well as lethal clouds of chlorine gas being
released from several chemical plants in New Jersey and Delaware. He adds that the
U.S. Computer Emergency Response Team in Pittsburgh is being deluged with reports of
systems failing, but he hasnâ t had time to get the details yet.
Before you can ask the Senior Duty Officer where the President is, another officer
thrusts a phone at you. Itâ s the Deputy Secretary of Transportation. â  Are we under
attack?â she asks. When you ask why, she ticks off what has happened. The Federal
Aviation Administrationâ s National Air Traffic Control Center in Herndon, Virginia, has
experienced a total collapse of its systems. The alternate center in Leesburg is in a
complete panic because it and several other regional centers cannot see what aircraft are
aloft and are trying to manually identify and separate hundreds of aircraft. Brickyard, the
Indianapolis Center, has already reported a midair collision of two 737s. â  I thought it
was just an FAA crisis, but then the train wrecks started happeningâ ¦â she explains. The
Federal Railroad Administration has been told of major freight derailments in Long
Beach, Norfolk, Chicago, and Kansas City.
Page 35
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Looking at the status board for the location of the President, you see it says only
â  Washington-OTR.â He is on an â  off the record,â or personal, activity outside the White
House. Reading your mind, the Senior Duty Officer explains that the President has taken
the First Lady to a hip new restaurant in Georgetown. â  Then put me through to the head
of his Secret Service detail,â says a breathless voice. Itâ s the Secretary of the Treasury,
who has run from his office in the building next to the White House. â  The Chairman of the
Fed just called. Their data centers and their backups have had some sort of major
disaster. They have lost all their data. Its affecting the data centers at DTCC and SIAC
â theyâ re going down, too.â He explains that those initials represent important financial
computer centers in New York. â  Nobody will know who owns what. The entire financial
system will dissolve by morning.â
As he says that, your eyes are drawn to a television screen reporting on a derailment
on the Washington Metro in a tunnel under the Potomac. Another screen shows a raging
flame in the Virginia suburbs where a major gas pipeline has exploded. Then the lights in
the Situation Room flicker. Then they go out. Battery-operated emergency spotlights
come on, casting the room in shadows and bright light. The television flat screens and the
computer monitors have gone blank. The lights flicker again and come back on, as do
some of the screens. There is a distant, loud droning. â  Itâ s the backup generator, sir,â the
Duty Officer says. His deputy again hands you a secure phone and mouths the words
you did not want to hear: â  Itâ s for you. Itâ s POTUS.â
The President is in the Beast, his giant armored vehicle that resembles a Cadillac on
steroids, on his way back from the restaurant. The Secret Service pulled him out of the
restaurant when the blackout hit, but they are having a hard time getting through the
traffic. Washingtonâ s streets are filled with car wrecks because the signal lights are all out.
POTUS wants to know if itâ s true what his Secret Service agent told him, that the
blackout is covering the entire eastern half of the country. â  No, wait, what? Now theyâ re
saying that the Vice Presidentâ s detail says itâ s out where he is, too. Isnâ t he in San
Francisco today? What time is it there?â
You look at your watch. Itâ s now 8:15 p.m. Within a quarter of an hour, 157 major
metropolitan areas have been thrown into knots by a nationwide power blackout hitting
during rush hour. Poison gas clouds are wafting toward Wilmington and Houston.
Refineries are burning up oil supplies in several cities. Subways have crashed in New
York, Oakland, Washington, and Los Angeles. Freight trains have derailed outside
major junctions and marshaling yards on four major railroads. Aircraft are literally falling
out of the sky as a result of midair collisions across the country. Pipelines carrying natural
gas to the Northeast have exploded, leaving millions in the cold. The financial system has
also frozen solid because of terabytes of information at data centers being wiped out.
Weather, navigation, and communications satellites are spinning out of their orbits into
space. And the U.S. military is a series of isolated units, struggling to communicate with
each other.
Several thousand Americans have already died, multiples of that number are injured
and trying to get to hospitals. There is more going on, but the people who should be
reporting to you canâ t get through. In the days ahead, cities will run out of food because
of the train-system failures and the jumbling of data at trucking and distribution centers.
Power will not come back up because nuclear plants have gone into secure lockdown
and many conventional plants have had their generators permanently damaged.
High-tension transmission lines on several key routes have caught fire and melted. Unable
to get cash from ATMs or bank branches, some Americans will begin to loot stores.
Police and emergency services will be overwhelmed.
In all the wars America has fought, no nation has ever done this kind of damage to our
cities. A sophisticated cyber war attack by one of several nation-states could do that

today, in fifteen minutes, without a single terrorist or soldier ever appearing in this
country. Why havenâ t they done it by now, if they can? For the same reason that the nine
nations with nuclear weapons havenâ t used one of them since 1945, because they need
to have the political circumstances that cause them to believe such an attack would be in
their interest. But unlike with nuclear weapons, where an attacker may be deterred by the
promise of retaliation or by the radioactive blow-back on his own country, launching a
cyber attack may run fewer risks. In cyber war, we may never even know what hit us.
Indeed, it may give little solace to Americans shivering without power to know that the
United States may be about to retaliate in kind.
â  While you were on the line with the President, sir, Cyber Command called from Fort
Meade. They think the attack came from Russia and they are ready to turn out the lights
in Moscow, sir. Or maybe it was China, so they are ready to hit Beijing, if you want to
do that. Sir?â

CHAPTER THREE
THE BATTLESPACE
Cyberspace. It sounds like another dimension, perhaps with green lighting and columns of numbers and
symbols flashing in midair, as in the movie The Matrix. Cyberspace is actually much more mundane. Itâ s
the laptop you or your kid carries to school, the desktop computer at work. Itâ s a drab windowless
building downtown and a pipe under the street. Itâ s everywhere, everywhere thereâ s a computer, or a
processor, or a cable connecting to one.
And now itâ s a war zone, where many of the decisive battles in the twenty-first century will play out.
To understand why, we need to answer some prior questions, like: What is cyberspace? How does it
work? How can militaries fight in it?
HOW AND WHY CYBER WAR IS POSSIBLE
Cyberspace is all of the computer networks in the world and everything they connect and control. Itâ s not
just the Internet. Letâ s be clear about the difference. The Internet is an open network of networks. From
any network on the Internet, you should be able to communicate with any computer connected to any of
the Internetâ s networks. Cyberspace includes the Internet plus lots of other networks of computers that
are not supposed to be accessible from the Internet. Some of those private networks look just like the
Internet, but they are, theoretically at least, separate. Other parts of cyberspace are transactional
networks that do things like send data about money flows, stock market trades, and credit card
transactions. Some networks are control systems that just allow machines to speak to other machines,
like control panels talking to pumps, elevators, and generators.
What makes these networks a place where militaries can fight? In the broadest terms, cyber warriors
can get into these networks and control or crash them. If they take over a network, cyber warriors could
steal all of its information or send out instructions that move money, spill oil, vent gas, blow up
generators, derail trains, crash airplanes, send a platoon into an ambush, or cause a missile to detonate in
the wrong place. If cyber warriors crash networks, wipe out data, and turn computers into doorstops,
then a financial system could collapse, a supply chain could halt, a satellite could spin out of orbit into
space, an airline could be grounded. These are not hypotheticals. Things like this have already happened,
sometimes experimentally, sometimes by mistake, and sometimes as a result of cyber crime or cyber war.
As Admiral Mike McConnell has noted, â  information managed by computer networksâ which run our
utilities, our transportation, our banking and communicationsâ can be exploited or attacked in seconds
from a remote location overseas. No flotilla of ships or intercontinental missiles or standing armies can
defend against such remote attacks located not only well beyond our borders, but beyond physical
space, in the digital ether of cyberspace.â
Why, then, do we run sophisticated computer networks that allow unauthorized access or
unauthorized commands? Arenâ t there security measures? The design of computer networks, the
software and hardware that make them work, and the way in which they were architected, create
thousands of ways that cyber warriors can get around security defenses. People write software and
people make mistakes, or get sloppy, and that creates opportunities. Networks that arenâ t supposed to
be connected to the public Internet very often actually are, sometimes without their owners even
knowing. Letâ s look at some things in your daily life as a way of explaining how cyber war can happen.
Do you think your condominium association knows that the elevator in your building is, like ET in the
movie of the same name, â  phoning homeâ? Your elevator is talking over the Internet to the people who
made it. Did you know that the photocopier in your office is probably doing the same thing? Julia Roberts
â s character in the recent movie Duplicity knew that many copying machines are connected to the
Internet and can be hacked, but most people donâ t know that their copier could even be online. Even
fewer think about the latest trick, shredders that image. Just before all those sensitive documents pass
through the knives that cut them into little pieces, they go by a camera that photographs them. Later, the
cleaning crew guy will take his new collection of pictures away to whoever hired him.
Your elevator and copier â  phoning homeâ is supposed to be happening, the software is working
Page 38
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
properly. But what if your competitor has a computer programmer who wrote a few lines of code and
slipped them into the processor that runs your photocopier? Letâ s say those few lines of computer code
instruct the copier to store an image of everything it copies and put them into a compressed data (or zip)
file. Then, once a day, the copier accesses the Internet andâ ping!â it shoots that zip file across the
country to your competitor. Even worse, on the day before your company has to submit a competitive
bid for a big contractâ ping!â the photocopier catches fire, causing the sprinklers to turn on, the office
to get soaked, and your company to be unable to get its bid done in time. The competitor wins, you lose.
Using an Internet connection you did not know existed, someone wrote software and downloaded it
onto your photocopier, which you did not even know had an onboard processor big enough to be a
computer. Then that someone used the software to make the photocopier do something it wouldnâ t
otherwise do, short-circuit or jam and overheat. They knew the result would be a fire. They probably
experimented with a copier just like yours. The result is your office is flooded by the sprinkler system and
you think it was an accident. Somebody reached out from cyberspace and made your physical space a
mess. That someone is a hacker. Originally â  hackerâ meant just somebody who could write instructions
in the code that is the language of computers to get them to do new things. When they do something like
going where they are not authorized, hackers become cyber criminals. When they work for the U.S.
military, we call them cyber warriors.
In this scenario, the cyber criminal used the Internet as his avenue of attack, first to get information and
then to do damage. His weapon was a few lines of software, which he inserted into the computer in the
copier. Or you may think about it this way: he used software to turn your copier into the weapon. He
succeeded because the software program that ran the copier was written to allow people to add
commands and give those commands remotely. The designers of the copier never thought anyone would
make it a weapon, so they never wrote their software in a manner that would make that difficult or
impossible to do. The same is true of the designers of the electric power grid and other systems. They
didnâ t think about people hacking them and turning their systems into weapons. Your office manager didn
â t pay attention when the salesperson said the copier would have a remote diagnostics capability to
download improvements, fix problems, and dispatch a repairman with the right replacement parts.
Hackers paid attention, or maybe they were just exploring their cyberspace neighborhood and found an
address that identified itself as â  Xeonera Copier 2000, serial number 20-003488, at Your Company,
Inc.â
If you doubt that copiers are part of cyberspace, read Image Source Magazine:
Historically, remote diagnostics required dial up modems. The methodology at that time was
somewhat of an inconvenience to the customer and very expensive for the dealer who had to install
phone jacks near each device and switch boxes to be compatible with their clientâ s phone systems.
But those barriers have now been eliminated with the introduction of the web and wireless networks.
Now that all networked devices have an address, a diagnostic error report can be transmitted in real
time via the web and technicians can be dispatched by the device itself, sometimes before the
customer knows there is a problem. Today, there is no excuse for any service organization to ignore
the cost savings and value of remote diagnostics. Virtually every printer manufacturer either has their
own remote diagnostic tool (i.e. Ricohâ s Remote, Kyocera Admin, Sharpâ s Admin, Xeroxâ s DRM) or
have partnered with third party companies like Imaging Portals or Print Fleet.
While mundane, this hypothetical scenario is helpful because it shows the three things involved in
cyberspace that make cyber war possible: (1) flaws in the design of the Internet; (2) flaws in hardware
and software; and (3) the move to put more and more critical systems online. Letâ s look at each.
VULNERABILITIES OF THE INTERNET
There are at least five major vulnerabilities in the design of the Internet itself. The first of these is the
addressing system that finds out where to go on the Internet for a specific address.
ISPs are sometimes called â  carriers,â because they are the companies that carry the Internetâ s traffic.
Other companies make the computer terminals, the routers, the servers, the software, but it is the ISPs
that link them all together. All ISPs are not created equal. For our discussion, letâ s divide them into two
Page 39
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
categories. There are the national ISPs that own and operate thousands of miles of fiber-optic cable
running from coast to coast, connecting all the big cities. There are six of these big ISPs in the United
States (Verizon, AT&T, Qwest, Sprint, Level 3, and Global Crossing). Because their big fiber-optic
cable pipes form the spine of the Internet in the U.S., they are called the â  backbone providers,â or, more
technically, the Tier 1 ISPs. Once they get the backbone into your city, they connect up with lots of
smaller ISPs that run service to local businesses and to your house. Your local ISP is probably the phone
company or the cable TV company. (If itâ s the phone company, it may be that you have one of the Tier 1
ISPs also providing your local service.) Their wires run from your house down the street to the world.
To see how this works, and to discover some of the vulnerabilities of the Internet addressing system,
follow what happens when I connect to the Internet. I open a â  browserâ on my laptop. Just by opening
the browser, I am requesting that it go out onto the Internet and bring back â  my homepage.â Letâ s say
that â  homepageâ is that of the consulting firm where I work. So, sitting in my home office in
Rappahannock County, Virginia, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, I click and my browser
goes to www.mycompany.com. Since computers canâ t understand words like â  mycompany,â the
address needs to be translated into 1â s and 0â s that computers can read. To do that, my browser uses
the Domain Name System. Think of it as the 411 information operator. You say a name, you get a
number.
My consulting firm is headquartered seventy-five miles away from my home in Virginia, but its
webpage is hosted on a remote server in Minneapolis with the Internet address of, letâ s say,
123.45.678.90. That is a lot of numbers to memorize. Luckily I donâ t have to. The browser uses the
Domain Name System to look up the address. The browser sends a message to a database kept on a
server computer, part of an elaborate hierarchy of such computers that together form the Domain Name
System. For cyber warriors, the Domain Name System is a target. It was designed with little thought to
security, so hackers can change its information and misdirect you to a phony webpage.
When I open up the browser it sends a request to the server hosting the page. The request is broken
down into a series of packets that are each sent individually. Letâ s trace just one packet along its way
from my computer to the website. The first hop is from my computer to the wi-fi card in my computer,
where the packets are translated into radio waves and sent out over the air to the wi-fi router in my
house. If that router is improperly secured, hackers can get into the computer over the wi-fi connection.
The wi-fi router turns the signal back from a radio wave into an electronic signal passed to my local ISP
in the booming megalopolis of Culpepper, Virginia.
If you know it, you may think that Culpepper is lovely, but not necessarily near the heart of
cyberspace. Because itâ s just beyond the blast radius if a nuclear weapon were to go off in Washington,
the government and the financial community have all sorts of databases nearby. So, there is an AT&T
node there, at 13456 Lovers Lane. (Really.) My ISP has a line running across town to the AT&T facility,
where the electrons of my request for the webpage get converted into photons so they can hop on
AT&Tâ s fiber-optic network. Once on the fiber, the packet first hits a router in Morristown, New Jersey,
is passed to another AT&T router in Washington, D.C., and then back to New Jersey, this time to a
router in Middletown.
At Middletown, the router passes the packet to another Tier 1 company, Level 3. Once on the Level
3 backbone, the packet is routed through three different nodes in Washington, D.C. At this point, the
packet has traveled over radio waves, copper wires, and high-speed bundles of fiber-optic cables for
more than 800 miles, but is only about 75 miles from where I first sent it off. The last Level 3 router, in
Washington, sends it speeding toward Chicago (now we are getting somewhere), where it descends
through two more Level 3 routers before being sent to Minneapolis. What goes to Minneapolis, though,
does not necessarily stay in Minneapolis. Instead of handing off to our web hosting provider, the packet
goes another 741 miles to another Level 3 router in the companyâ s headquarters in Broomfield,
Colorado, which then routes the packet back to our companyâ s ISP, in Minneapolis, and on to our web
server. To travel the 900 miles to Minneapolis, the packet went about 2,000 miles out of its way, but the
whole process took a few seconds. It also provided several opportunities for cyber warriors.
If cyber warriors had wanted to send those packets to the wrong place, or to prevent them from going
Page 40
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
anywhere, they had at least two opportunities. First, as noted earlier, they could have attacked that
Internet 411, the Domain Name System, and sent me to the wrong page, perhaps to a phony look-alike
webpage, where I would enter my account number and password. Rather than hacking the Domain
Name System to hijack a webpage request, however, cyber warriors could attack the system itself. This
is just what happened in February 2007, when six of the thirteen top-level worldwide domain servers
were targeted in a DDOS attack. Similar to the botnets that hit Estonia and Georgia, the attack flooded
the domain name servers with thousands of requests per second. Two of the servers targeted were taken
down, including one that handles traffic for the Department of Defense. The other four were able to
manage the attack by shifting requests to other servers not targeted in the attack. The attack was traced
back to the Pacific region and lasted only eight hours. The attackers stopped it either because they were
afraid continuing it would allow investigators to trace it back to them or, more likely, because they were
just testing to see if they could do it.
In 2008, the hacker Dan Kaminsky showed how a sophisticated adversary could hack the system.
Kaminsky released a software tool that could quietly access the Domain Name System computers and
corrupt the database of name addresses and their related numbered addresses. The system would then
literally give you a wrong number. Just misdirecting traffic could cause havoc with the Internet. One cyber
security company found twenty-five different ways it could hack the Domain Name System to cause
disruption or data theft.
The second vulnerability of the Internet is routing among ISPs, a system known as the Border
Gateway Protocol. Another opportunity for a cyber warrior in the one-second, 2,000-mile trip of
packets from my home came when they jumped onto the AT&T network. AT&T runs the most secure
and reliable Internet service in the world, but it is as vulnerable as anyone else to the way the Internet
works. When the packets got on the backbone, they found that AT&T does not connect directly to my
company. So who does? The packets checked a database that all of the major ISPs contribute to. There
they found a posting from Level 3 that said, in effect, â  If you want to connect to mycompany.com, come
to us.â This routing system regulates traffic at the points where the ISPs come together, where one starts
and the other stops, at their borders.
BGP is the main system used to route packets across the Internet. The packets have labels with a â  toâ
and â  fromâ address, and BGP is the postal worker that decides what sorting station the packet goes to
next. BGP also does the job of establishing â  peerâ relationships between two routers on two different
networks. To go from AT&T to Level 3 requires that an AT&T router and a Level 3 router have a BGP
connection. To quote from a report from Internet Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to
developing Internet-related standards and policies, â  There are no mechanisms internal to BGP that
protect against attacks that modify, delete, forge, or replay data, any of which has the potential to disrupt
overall network routing behavior.â What that means is that when Level 3 said, â  If you want to get to
mycompany.com, come to me,â nobody checked to see if that was an authentic message. The BGP
system works on trust, not, to borrow Ronald Reaganâ s favorite phrase, on â  trust but verify.â If a rogue
insider working for one of the big ISPs wanted to cause the Internet to seize up, he could do it by
hacking into the BGP tables. Or someone could hack in from outside. If you spoof enough BGP
instructions, Internet traffic will get lost and not reach its destination.
Everyone involved in network management for the big ISPs knows about the vulnerabilities of the
Domain Name System and the BGP. People like Steve Kent of BBN Labs in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, have even developed ways of eliminating those vulnerabilities, but the Federal
Communications Commission has not required the ISPs to do so. Parts of the U.S. government are
deploying a secure Domain Name System, but the practice is almost nonexistent in the commercial
infrastructure. Decisions on the Domain Name System are made by a nongovernmental international
organization called ICANN (pronounced â  eye-canâ), which is unable (â  eye-cannotâ) to get agreement
on a secure system. The result is that the Internet itself could easily be a target for cyber warriors, but
most cyber security experts think that unlikely because the Internet is so useful for attacking other things.
ICANN demonstrates the second vulnerability of the Internet, which is governance, or lack thereof.
No one is really in charge. In the early days of the Internet, ARPA (DoDâ s Advanced Research Project
Page 41
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Agency) filled the function of network administrator, but nobody does now. There are technical bodies,
but few authorities. ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, is the closest
that any organization has come to being responsible for the management of even one part of the Internet
system. ICANN ensures that web addresses are unique. Computers are logical devices, and they donâ t
deal well with ambiguity. If there were two different computers on the Internet each with the same
address, routers would not know what to do. ICANN solves that problem by working internationally to
assign addresses. ICANN solves one of the problems of Internet governance, but not a host of other
issues. More than a dozen intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations play some role in
Internet governance, but no authority provides overall administrative guidance or control.
The third vulnerability of the Internet is the fact that almost everything that makes it work is open,
unencrypted. When you are crawling around the web, most of the information is sent â  in the clear,â
meaning that it is unencrypted. Itâ s like your local FM classic rock station broadcasting Pink Floyd and
Def Leppard â  in the clearâ so that anyone tuned to that channel can receive the signal and rock along
rolling down the highway. A radio scanner purchased at Radio Shack can listen in on the two-way
communications between truckers, and in most cities, between police personnel. In some cities, however,
the police will â  scrambleâ the signal so that criminal gangs cannot monitor police comms. Only someone
with a radio that can unencrypt the traffic can hear what is being said. To everyone else, it just sounds
like static.
The Internet generally works the same way. Most communication is openly broadcast, and only a
fraction of the traffic is encrypted. The only difference is that it is a little more difficult to tune in to
someone elseâ s Internet traffic. ISPs have access (and can give it to the government), and mail-service
providers like Googleâ s Gmail have access (even if they say they donâ t). In both those cases, by using
their services you are more or less agreeing that they may be able to see your web traffic or e-mails. For
a third party to get access, they need to do what security folks call â  snoopâ and use a â  packet snifferâ to
pick up the traffic. A packet sniffer is basically a wiretap device for Internet traffic and can be installed on
any operating system and used to steal other peopleâ s traffic on a local area network. When plugged into
a local or an Ethernet network, any user on the system can use a sniffer to pull in all the other traffic. The
standard Ethernet protocol tells your computer to ignore everything that is not addressed to it, but that
doesnâ t mean it has to. An advanced packet sniffer on an Ethernet network can look at all the traffic.
Your neighbors could sniff everything on the Internet on your street. More advanced sniffers can trick the
network in what is known as a â  man-in-the-middleâ attack. The sniffer appears to the router as the userâ s
computer. All information is sent to the sniffer, which then copies the information before passing it on to
the real addressee.
Many (but not most) websites now use a secure, encrypted connection when you log on so that your
password is not sent in the clear for anyone sniffing around to pick up. Due to cost and speed, most then
drop the connection back into an unsecure mode after the password transmission is made. When sniffing
the transmission isnâ t possible, or when the data being sent is unreadable, that doesnâ t mean you are safe.
A keystroke logger, a small hidden piece of malicious code installed surreptitiously on your computer,
can capture everything you type and then transmit it secretly. Of course, this type of keystroke logger
does require you to do something stupid in order for it to be installed on your computer, such as visiting a
website that has been infected or downloading a file from an e-mail that is not really from someone you
trust. In October 2008 the BBC reported that â  computer scientists at the Security and Cryptography
Laboratory at the Swiss Ecole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne have demonstrated that criminals
could use a radio antenna to â fully or partially recover keystrokesâ  by spotting the electromagnetic
radiation emitted when keys were pressed.â
A fourth vulnerability of the Internet is its ability to propagate intentionally malicious traffic designed to
attack computers, malware. Viruses, worms, and phishing scams are collectively known as â  malware.â
They take advantage of both flaws in software and user errors like going to infected websites or opening
attachments. Viruses are programs passed from user to user (over the Internet or via a portable format
like a flash drive) that carry some form of payload to either disrupt a computerâ s normal operation,
provide a hidden access point to the system, or copy and steal private information. Worms do not
Page 42
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
require a user to pass the program on to another user; they can copy themselves by taking advantage of
known vulnerabilities and â  wormâ their way across the Internet. Phishing scams try to trick an Internet
user into providing information such as bank account numbers and access codes by creating e-mail
messages and phony websites that pretend to be related to legitimate businesses, such as your bank.
All this traffic is allowed to flow across the Internet with few, if any, checks on it. For the most part,
you as an Internet user are responsible for providing your own protection. Most ISPs do not take even
the most basic steps to keep bad traffic from getting to your computer, in part because it is expensive and
can slow down the traffic, and also because of privacy concerns.
The fifth Internet vulnerability is the fact that it is one big network with a decentralized design. The
designers of the Internet did not want it to be controlled by governments, either singly or collectively, and
so they designed a system that placed a higher priority on decentralization than on security. The basic
idea of the Internet began to form in the early 1960s, and the Internet as we know it today is deeply
imbued with the sensibilities and campus politics of that era. While many regard the Internet as an
invention of the military, it is really the product of now aging hippies on the campuses of MIT, Stanford,
and Berkeley. They had funding through DARPA, the Defense Departmentâ s Advanced Research
Project Agency, but the ARPANET, the Advanced Research Project Agencyâ s Network, was not
created just for the Defense Department to communicate. It initially connected four computers: at UCLA,
Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, and, oddly, the University of Utah.
After building the ARPANET, the Internetâ s pioneers quickly moved on to figuring out how to connect
the ARPANET to other networks under development. In order to do that, they developed the basic
transmission protocol still used today. Robert Kahn, one of the ten or so people generally regarded as
having created the Internet, laid out four principles for how these exchanges would take place. They are
worth noting here now:
ï· Each distinct network should have to stand on its own, and no internal changes
should be required to any such network to connect it to the Internet.
ï· Communications should be on a best-effort basis. If a packet didnâ t make it to
the final destination, it should be retransmitted shortly from the source.
ï· Black boxes would be used to connect the networks; these would later be
called gateways and routers. There should be no information retained by the
gateways about the individual packets passing through them, thereby keeping
them simple and avoiding complicated adaptation and recovery from various
failure modes.
ï· There should be no global control at the operations level.
While the protocols that were developed based on these rules allowed for the massive growth
in networking and the creation of the Internet as we know it today, they also sowed the seeds for
the security problems. The writers of these ground rules did not imagine that anyone other than
well-meaning academics and government scientists would use the Internet. It was for research
purposes, for the exchange of ideas, not for commerce, where money would change hands, or
for the purposes of controlling critical systems. Thus, it could be one network of networks, rather
than separate networks for government, financial activity, etc. It was designed for thousands of
researchers, not billions of users who did not know and trust each other.
Up to and through the 1990s, the Internet was almost universally seen as a force for good.
Few of the Internetâ s boosters were willing to admit that the Internet was a neutral medium. It
could easily be used to facilitate the free flow of communication between scientists and the
creation of legitimate e-commerce, but could also allow terrorists to provide training tips to new
recruits and to transmit the latest beheading out of Anbar Province on a web video. The Internet,
much like the tribal areas of Pakistan or the tri-border region in South America, is not under the
control of anyone and is therefore a place to which the lawless will gravitate.
Larry Roberts, who wrote the code for the first versions of the transmission protocol, realized
that the protocols created an unsecure system, but he did not want to slow down the
development of the new network and take the time to fix the software before deploying it. He
Page 43
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
had a simple answer for the concern. It was a small network. Rather than trying to write secure
software to control the dissemination of information on the network, Roberts concluded that it
would be far easier to secure the transmission lines by encrypting the links between each
computer on the network. After all, the early routers were all in secure locations in government
agencies and academic laboratories. If the information was secure as it traveled between two
points on the network, that was all that really mattered. The problem was that the solution did not
envision the expansion of the technology beyond the handful of sixty-odd computers that then
made up the network. Trusted people ran all those sixty computers. A precondition for joining
the network was that you were a known entity committed to promoting scientific advancement.
And with so few people, if anything bad got on the network, it would not be hard to get it off and
to identify who had put it there.
Then Vint Cerf left ARPA and joined MCI. Vint is a friend, a friend with whom I
fundamentally disagree about how the Internet should be secured. But Vint is one of those
handful of people who can legitimately be called â  a father of the Internet,â so what he thinks on
Internet issues usually counts for a lot more than what I say. Besides, Vint, who always wears a
bow tie, is a charming guy, and he now works for Google, which urges us all not to be evil.
MCI (now part of AT&T) was the first major telecommunications company to lay down a
piece of the Internet backbone and to take the technology out of the small network of
government scientists and academics, offering it to corporations and even, through ISPs, to home
users. Vint took the transmission protocol with him, introducing the security problem to a far
larger audience and to a network that could not be secured through encrypting the links. No one
really knew who was connecting to the MCI network.
There are bound to be vulnerabilities in anything so large. Today, it has grown so extensive
that the Internet is running out of addresses. When the Internet was cobbled together, the
inventors came up with a numbering system to identify every device that would connect to the
network. They decided that all addresses had to be a 32-bit number, a number so large that it
would allow for 4.29 billion addresses. Never did they imagine that we would need more than
that.
As of last count, there are nearly 6.8 billion people living on the planet. On the current
standard, thatâ s more than one address for every two people. And today, that is not enough. As
the West grows more dependent on the Internet, and as the Second and Third worlds expand
their use, 4.29 billion addresses cannot possibly satisfy all the possible people and devices that
will want to connect to the web. That the Internet is running out of addresses on its own may be a
manageable problem. If we move quickly to converting to the IPv6 address standard, by the time
we run out of IPv4 addresses, in about two years, most devices should be able to operate on the
new standard. But step back for a moment and a cause for concern begins to emerge.
The Pentagon envisions a near-future scenario in which every soldier on the battlefield will be a
hub in a network, and as many as a dozen devices carried by that soldier will be plugged into the
network and require their own addresses. If you stroll through the appliance aisle at a high-end
home-goods store, you will notice that many of the washing machines, dryers, dishwashers,
stoves, and refrigerators are advertising that they can be controlled through the Internet. If you
are at work and want the oven to be preheated to 425 degrees when you arrive home, you could
log onto a webpage, access your oven, and set it to the right temperature from your desktop.
What all this means is that as we move beyond 4.29 billion internal web addresses, the degree
to which our society will be dependent on the Internet, for everything from controlling our
thermostats to defending our nation, is set to explode, and with it the security problem is only
going to get worse. What this could mean in a real-world conflict is something that until recently
most policy makers in the Pentagon were loath to think about. It means that if you can hack into
things on the Internet, you might not just be able to steal money. You might be able to cause
some real damage, including damage to our military. So exactly how is it that you can hack into
things, and why is that possible?

SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE
Of the three things about cyberspace that make cyber war possible, the most important may be
the flaws in the software and hardware. All of those devices on the Internet we just discussed
(the computer terminals and laptops, the routers and switches, the e-mail and webpage servers,
the data files) are made by a large number of companies. Often, separate companies make the
software that run devices. In the U.S. market, most laptops are made by Dell, HP, and Apple.
(A Chinese company, Lenovo, is making a dent after having bought IBMâ s laptop computer
unit.) Most big routers are made by Cisco and Juniper, and now the Chinese company Huawei.
Servers are made by HP, Dell, IBM, and a large number of others, depending upon their
purpose. The software they run is written mainly by Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, and Apple, but also
by many other companies. Although these are all U.S. corporations, the machines (and
sometimes the code that runs on them) come from many places.
In The World Is Flat, Thomas Friedman traces the production of his Dell Inspiron 600m
notebook from the phone order he places with a customer-service representative in India to its
delivery at his front door in suburban Maryland. His computer was assembled at a factory in
Penang, Malaysia. It was â  co-designedâ by a team of Dell engineers in Austin and notebook
designers in Taiwan. Most of the hard work, the design of the motherboard, was done by the
Taiwanese team. For the rest of the thirty key components, Dell used a string of different
suppliers. Its Intel processor might have been made in the Philippines, Costa Rica, Malaysia, or
China. Its memory might have been made in Korea by Samsung, or by lesser-known companies
in Germany or Japan. Its graphic card came from one of two factories in China. The
motherboard, while designed in Taiwan, could have been made at a factory there, but probably
came from one of two plants in Mainland China. The keyboard came from one of three factories
in China, two of them owned by Taiwanese companies. The wireless card was made either by an
American-owned company in China or by a Chinese-owned company in Malaysia or in Taiwan.
The hard drive was probably made by the American company Seagate at a factory in Singapore,
or by Hitachi or Fujitsu in Thailand, or by Toshiba in the Philippines.
After all these parts were assembled at the factory in Malaysia, a digital image of the Windows
XP operating system (and probably Windows Office) was burned onto the hard drive. The code
for that software, amounting to more than 40 million lines for XP alone, was written at a dozen or
more locations worldwide. After the system was imprinted with the software, the computer was
packaged up, placed on a pallet with 150 similar computers, and flown on a 747 to Nashville.
From there, the laptop was picked up by UPS and shipped to Friedman. All told, Friedman
proudly reports that â  the total supply chain for my computer, including suppliers of suppliers,
involved about four hundred companies in North America, Europe, and primarily Asia.â
Why does Friedman spend six pages in a book about geopolitics documenting the supply
chain for the computer he wrote the book on? Because he believes that the supply chain that built
his computer knits together the countries that were part of that process in a way that makes
interstate conflicts of the sort we saw in the twentieth century less likely. Friedman admits this is
an update of his â  Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Preventionâ from his previous book, which
argued that two states that both had a McDonaldâ s would not go to war with each other. This
time, Friedmanâ s tongue-in-cheek argument has a little more meat to it than the hamburger
theory. The supply chain is a microeconomic example of the trade that many theorists of
international relations believe is so beneficial to the countries involved that even threatening war
would not be worth the potential economic loss. Friedman looks at the averted crisis in 2004,
when Taiwanese politicians running on a pro-independence platform were voted out of office. In
his cute bumper-sticker-slogan way, Friedman observed that â  Motherboards won over
motherland,â concluding that the status quo economic relationship was more valuable than
independence to the Taiwanese voters.
Or maybe the Taiwanese voters just didnâ t want to end up dead after China invaded, which is
Page 45
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
what China more or less said it would do if Taiwan declared its independence. What Friedman
sees as a force that makes conflict less likely, the supply chain for producing computers, may in
fact make cyber warfare more likely, or at least make it more likely that the Chinese would win in
any conflict. At any point in the supply chain that put together Friedmanâ s computer (or your
computer, or the Apple MacBook Pro that I am writing this book on), vulnerabilities were
introduced, most accidentally, but probably some intentionally, that can make it both a target and
a weapon in a cyber war.
Software is used as an intermediary between human and machine, to translate the human
intention to find movie times online or read a blog, into something that a machine can understand.
Computers really are just evolved electronic calculators. Early computer scientists realized that
timed electrical pulses could be used to represent 1â s and that the absence of a pulse could be
used to represent 0â s, like long and short bursts in Morse code. The base-10 numbers that
humans use, because we have ten fingers, could be translated into this binary code that a machine
could understand so that when, for instance, the 5 key on an early electronic calculator was
depressed, it would close circuits that would send a pulse followed by a pause followed by
another pulse in quick succession to represent the 1, 0, and 1 that make up the number 5 in a
binary logic system.
All computers today are just evolutions of that same basic process. A simple e-mail message is
converted into electric pulses that can be carried over copper wires and fiber-optic cables and
then retranslated into a message readable to a human eye. To make that happen someone
needed to provide instructions that a computer could understand. Those instructions are written
in programming languages as computer code, and most people who write code make mistakes.
The obvious ones get fixed, or else the computer program does not function as intended; but the
less-obvious ones are often left in the code and can be exploited later to gain access. As
computer systems have gotten faster, computer programs have grown more complex to take
advantage of all the new speed and power. Windows 95 had less than 10 million lines of code.
Windows XP, 40 million. Windows Vista, more than 50 million. In a little over a decade, the
number of lines of code has grown by a factor of five, and with it the number of coding errors.
Many of those coding errors allow hackers to make the software do something it was not
supposed to, like let them in.
In order to manipulate popular software to do the wrong thing, like let you assume system
administrator status, hackers design small applications, â  applets,â that are focused on specific
software design or system configuration weaknesses and mistakes. Because computer crime is a
big business, and getting ready to conduct cyber war is even well-funded, criminal hackers and
cyber warriors are constantly generating new ways to trick systems. These hacker applications
are called malware. On average in 2009, a new type or variant of malware was entering
cyberspace every 2.2 seconds. Do the math. The three or four big antivirus software companies
have sophisticated networks to look for the new malware, but they find and issue a â  fixâ for
about one in every ten pieces of malware. The fix is a piece of software designed to block the
malware. By the time the fix gets to the antivirus companyâ s customers, often days, and
sometimes weeks, have gone by. During that time, companies, government departments, and
home users are entirely vulnerable to the new malware. They wonâ t even know if they have been
hit by it.
Frequently the malware is sitting on innocent websites, waiting for you. Letâ s say you surf to
the website of a Washington think tank to read their latest analysis of some important public
policy issue. Think tanks are notorious for not having enough money and not giving enough
attention to creating secure and safe websites. So, as you are reading about the latest
machinations over health care or human rights in China, a little piece of malware is downloading
itself onto your computer. You have no way of knowing, but now your new friend in Belarus is
logging your every keystroke. What happens when you log into your bank account or to the
Virtual Private Network of your employer, the Really Big Defense Company? You can probably
Page 46
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
guess.
The most common software error for years, and one of the easiest to explain, is something
called â  buffer overflow.â Code for a webpage is supposed to be written in such a way that when
a user comes to that webpage, the user can only enter a certain amount of data, like a user name
and password. Itâ s supposed to be like Twitter, a program where you can enter, say, no more
than 140 characters. But if the code writer forgets to put in the symbols that limit the number of
characters, then a user can put in more. Instead of just putting in a user name or password, you
could enter entire lines of instruction code. Maybe you enter instructions to allow you to add an
account. Think about those instructions overflowing the limited area where a public user is
supposed to be able to add information and then those instructions falling into the application.
The instruction code reads as if a systems administrator had entered it andâ ping!â you are
inside.
Software errors are not easily discovered. Even experts cannot usually visually identify coding
errors or intentional vulnerabilities in a few lines of code, let alone in millions. There is now
software that checks software, but it is far from able to catch all the glitches in millions of lines.
Each line of that code had to be written by a computer programmer, and each additional line of
code increased the number of bugs introduced into the software. In some cases, programmers
actually put those bugs in intentionally. The most famous case, and one that illustrates a larger
phenomenon, occurred when somebody at Microsoft dumped an entire airplane-simulation
program inside the Excel 97 database software. Microsoft only discovered it when people
started thanking the company for it. Programmers may do it for fun, for profit, or in the service of
a competing company or foreign intelligence service; but whatever their motive, it is a nearly
impossible task to ensure that a few lines of code allowing for unauthorized access through a
â  trapdoorâ are kept out of such massive programs. The original Trojan Horse had hidden
commandos; today we have hidden commands of malicious code. In the case of the Excel
spreadsheet, you began by opening a new blank document, pressing F5, and when a reference
box opened, you typed in â  X97:L97â and pressed enter, then pressed tab. This took you to cell
M97 on the spreadsheet. Then if you clicked on the chart wizard button while holding down the 
control and shift keysâ ping!â you activated a flight-simulator program, which popped right up.
Sometimes developers of code leave behind secret trapdoors so they can get back into the
code easily later on to update it. Sometimes, unknown to their company, they do it for less
reputable reasons. And sometimes other people, like hackers and cyber warriors, do it so they
can get into parts of a network where they are not authorized. Thus, when someone hacks into a
software product under development (or later), they may not just be stealing a copy, they may be
adding to it. Intentional trapdoors, as well as others that occur because of mistakes in code
writing, sometimes allow a hacker to gain what is called â  root.â Hackers trade or sell each other
â  root kits.â If you have â  root accessâ to a software program or a network, you have all the
permissions and authorities of the softwareâ s creator or the networkâ s administrator. You can
add software. You can add user accounts. You can do anything. And, importantly, you can erase
any evidence that you were ever there. Think of that as a burglar who wipes away his fingerprints
and then drags a broom behind him to the door, erasing his footprints.
Code developers may go one step further than just leaving an access point and insert a â  logic
bomb.â The term encompasses a spectrum of software applications, but the idea is simple. In
addition to leaving behind a trapdoor in a network so you can get back in easily, without setting
off alarms and without needing an account, cyber warriors often leave behind a logic bomb so
they donâ t have to take the time to upload it later on when they need to use it. A logic bomb in its
most basic form is simply an eraser, it erases all the software on a computer, leaving it a useless
hunk of metal. More advanced logic bombs could first order hardware to do something to
damage itself, like ordering an electric grid to produce a surge that fries circuits in transformers,
or causing an aircraftâ s control surfaces to go into the dive position. Then it erases everything,
including itself.
Page 47
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Americaâ s national security agencies are now getting worried about logic bombs, since they
seem to have found them all over our electric grid. There is a certain irony here, in that the U.S.
military invented this form of warfare. One of the first logic bombs, and possibly the first
incidence of cyber war, occurred before there even really was much of an Internet. In the early
1980s, the Soviet leadership gave their intelligence agency, the KGB, a shopping list of Western
technologies they wanted their spies to steal for them. A KGB agent who had access to the list
decided he would rather spend the rest of his days sipping wine in a Paris cafÃ© than freezing in
Stalingrad, so he turned the list over to the French intelligence service in exchange for a new life
in France. France, which was part of the Western alliance, gave it to the U.S. Unaware that
Western intelligence had the list, the KGB kept working its way down, stealing technologies from
a host of foreign companies. Once the French gave the list to the CIA, President Reagan gave it
the okay to help the Soviets with their technology needs, with a catch. The CIA started a massive
program to ensure that the Soviets were able to steal the technologies they needed, but the CIA
introduced a series of minor errors into the designs for things like stealth fighters and space
weapons.
Weapons designs, however, were not at the top of the KGBâ s wish list. What Russia really
needed was commercial and industrial technology, particularly for its oil and gas industry. In
order to get the product from the massive reserves in Siberia to Russian and Western consumers,
oil and gas had to be piped over thousands of miles. Russia lacked the technology for the
automated pump and valve controls crucial to managing a pipeline thousands of miles long. They
tried to buy it from U.S. companies, were refused, and so set their sights on stealing it from a
Canadian firm. With the complicity of our northern neighbors, the CIA inserted malicious code
into the software of the Canadian firm. When the Russians stole the code and used it to operate
their pipeline, it worked just fine, at least initially. After a while, the new control software started
to malfunction. In one segment of the pipeline, the software caused the pump on one end to
pump at its maximum rate and the valve at the other end to close. The pressure buildup resulted
in the most massive non-nuclear explosion ever recorded, over three kilotons.
If the Cold War with Russia heats up again, or if we were to go to war with China, this time it
might be our adversaries who have the upper hand in cyber war. The United Statesâ 
sophisticated arsenal of space-age weapons could be turned against us to devastating effect. Our
air, land, and sea forces rely on networked technologies that are vulnerable to cyber weapons
that China and other near peer adversaries have developed with the intention of eliminating our
conventional superiority. The U.S. military is no more capable of operating without the Internet
than Amazon.com would be. Logistics, command and control, fleet positioning, everything down
to targeting, all rely on software and other Internet-related technologies. And all of it is just as
insecure as your home computer, because it is all based on the same flawed underlying
technologies and uses the same insecure software and hardware.
With the growth of outsourcing to countries like India and China that Friedman got so excited
about, the likelihood that our peer competitors have been able to penetrate major software and
hardware companies and insert such code into the software we rely on has only increased. In the
world of computer science and networking, experts long thought that the two most ubiquitous
operating-system codes (software that tells hardware what to do) were also the most badly
written, or â  buggy,â computer code. They were Microsoftâ s Windows operating system for
desktop and laptop computers, and Ciscoâ s for large Internet routers. Both systems were
proprietary, meaning not publicly available. You could buy the software as a finished product, but
you could not get the underlying code. There were, however, several known instances in which
Microsoftâ s security was compromised and the code stolen, giving the recipient the opportunity
to identify the software errors and ways to exploit them.
I mentioned above (in chapter 2) that China had essentially blackmailed Microsoft into
cooperating with it. China had announced that it would develop its own system based on Linux,
called Red Flag, and said it would require that it be used instead of Microsoft. Soon Microsoft
Page 48
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
was bargaining with the Chinese government at the highest level, helped along by its consultant,
Henry Kissinger. Microsoft dropped its price, gave the Chinese its secret code, and established a
software research lab in Beijing (the lab is directly wired into Microsoftâ s U.S. headquarters). A
deal was struck. It must have been a good deal: the President of China then visited Bill Gates at
his home near Seattle. The Chinese government now uses Microsoft, but it is that special
variation with a Chinese government encryption module. One former U.S. intelligence officer told
us, â  This may mean that no one can hack Windows easily to spy on China. It certainly does not
mean that China is less able to hack Windows to spy on others.â
What can be done to millions of lines of code can also be done with millions of circuits
imprinted on computer chips inside computers, routers, and servers. Chips are the guts of a
computer, like software in silicon. They can be customized, just like software. Most experts
cannot look at a complicated computer chip and determine whether there is an extra piece here
or there, a physical trapdoor. Computer chips were originally made in the U.S., although now
they are mostly manufactured in Asia. The U.S. government once had its own chip factory, called
a â  fabâ (short for â  fabrication facilityâ); however, the facility has not kept pace with technology
and cannot manufacture the chips required for modern systems. Recently the worldâ s
second-largest chip manufacturer, AMD, announced its intentions to build the most advanced fab
in the world in upstate New York. It will be partially government funded, but not by the U.S.
government: AMD got a big investment from the United Arab Emirates.
It is not that the U.S. government is unaware of the problem of software and hardware being
made globally. In fact, in his last year in office, President George W. Bush signed PDD-54, a
secret document that outlines steps to be taken to defend the government better from cyber war.
One of those programs is reported to be a â  Supply Chain Securityâ initiative, but it will be
difficult for the U.S. government to purchase only software and hardware made in the U.S. under
secure conditions. Currently, it would be difficult to find any.
MACHINES CONTROLLED FROM CYBERSPACE
Neither the vulnerabilities of Internet design nor the flaws in software and hardware quite explain
how cyber warriors could make computers attack. How is it that some destructive hand can
reach out from cyberspace into the real world and cause serious damage?
The answer stems from the rapid adoption of the Internet and cyberspace by industries in the
U.S. in the 1990s. During that decade evangelical information-technology companies showed
other corporations how they could save vast amounts of money by taking advantage of computer
systems that could do things deep into their operations. Far beyond e-mail or word processing,
these business practices involved automated controls, inventory monitoring, just-in-time delivery,
database analytics, and limited applications of artificial-intelligence programs. One Silicon Valley
CEO told me enthusiastically in the late 1990s how he had applied these techniques to his own
firm. â  Somebody wants to buy something, they go online to our site. They customize the product
they want and hit BUY. Our system notifies the parts makers, plans to ship the parts to the
assembly plant, and schedules assembly and delivery. At the assembly plant, robotic devices put
the product together and put it in a box with a delivery label on it. We donâ t own the computer
server that took the order, the parts plants, the assembly plant, or the delivery aircraft and trucks.
Itâ s all outsourced and itâ s all just-in-time delivery.â What he owned was the research
department, the design team, and some corporate overhead. At companies like his, and in the
U.S. economy in general, profitability soared.
What made all of that possible was the deep penetration in the 1990s of
information-technology systems into companies, into every department. In many industries,
controls that were once manually activated were converted to digital processors. Picture the
factory or plant of the twentieth century where some guy in a hard hat got a call from his
supervisor telling him to go over and crank some round valve or change some setting. I can see it
vividly, my father worked in a place like that. Today, in almost every industry, fewer people are
Page 49
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
required. Digital control systems monitor activity and send commands to engines, valves,
switches, robotic arms, lights, cameras, doors, elevators, trains, and aircraft. Intelligent inventory
systems monitor sales in real time and send out the orders to make and ship replacements, often
without a human in the loop.
The conversion to digital control systems and computer-managed operations was quick and
thorough. By the turn of the century, most of the old systems were retired, even from the role of
â  backup.â Like CortÃ©s burning his ships after arriving in the New World, U.S. companies and
government agencies built a new world in which there were only computer-based systems. When
the computers fail, employees stand around doing nothing or go home. Try to find a typewriter
and you will get the picture of this new reality.
Just as the Internet, and cyberspace in general, is replete with software and hardware
problems and configuration shortcomings, so are the computer networks that run major
corporations, from utilities to transportation to manufacturing. Computer networks are essential
for companies or government agencies to operate. â  Essentialâ is a word chosen with care,
because it conveys the fact that we are dependent upon computer systems. Without them,
nothing works. If they get erroneous data, systems may work, but they will do the wrong things.
Despite all the money spent on computer security systems, it is still very possible to insert
erroneous data into networks. It can mean that systems shut down, or damage themselves, or
damage something else, or send things or people to the wrong places. At 3:28 p.m. on June 11,
1999, a pipeline burst in Bellingham, Washington. Gasoline began spilling out into the creek
below. The gas quickly extended well over a mile along the creek. Then it caught fire. Two
ten-year-old boys playing along the stream were killed, as was an eighteen-year-old farther up
the creek. The nearby municipal water-treatment plant was severely damaged by the fire. When
the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board examined why the pipeline burst, it focused on
â  the performance and security of the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.â
In other words, the software failed. The report does not conclude that in this case the explosion
was intentionally caused by a hacker, but it is obvious from the analysis that pipelines like the one
in Bellingham can be manipulated destructively from cyberspace.
The clearest example of the dependency and the vulnerability brought on by computer controls
also happens to be the one system that everything else depends upon: the electric power grid.
As a result of deregulation in the 1990s, electric power companies were divided up into
generating firms and transmission companies. They were also allowed to buy and sell power to
each other anywhere within one of the three big power grids in North America. At the same time,
they were, like every other company, inserting computer controls deep into their operations.
Computer controls were also installed to manage the buying and selling, generation, and
transmission. A SCADA system was already running each electric companyâ s substations,
transformers, and generators. That Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system got and
sent signals out to all of the thousands of devices on the companyâ s grid. SCADAs are software
programs, and most electric companies use one of a half dozen commercially available products.
These control programs send signals to devices to regulate the electric load in various
locations. The signals are most often sent via internal computer network and sometimes by radio.
Unfortunately, many of the devices also have other connections, multiple connections. One
survey found that a fifth of the devices on the electric grid had wireless or radio access, 40
percent had connections to the companyâ s internal computer network, and almost half had direct
connections to the Internet. Many of the Internet connections were put in place to permit their
manufacturers to do remote diagnostics.
Another survey found that at one very large electric company, 80 percent of the devices were
connected to the corporate intranet, and there were, of course, connections from the intranet out
to the public Internet. What that means is that if you can hack from the Internet to the intranet,
you can give orders to devices on the electric grid, perhaps from some nice cyber cafÃ© on the
other side of the planet. Numerous audits of electric power companies by well-respected cyber
Page 50
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
security experts have found that this is all very doable. What sort of things might you do with
controls to the grid?
In 2003, the so-called Slammer worm (big, successful computer malware attacks get their
own names) got into and slowed controls on the power grid. A software glitch in a widely used
SCADA system also contributed to the slowed controls. So when a falling tree created a surge in
a line in Ohio, the devices that should have stopped a cascading effect did not do so until the
blackout got to somewhere in southern New Jersey. The result was that eight states, two
Canadian provinces, and 50 million people were without electricity, and without everything that
needs electricity (such as the water system in Cleveland). The tree was the initiator, but the same
effects could have been achieved by a command given over the control system by a hacker. In
fact, in 2007 CIA expert Tom Donahue was authorized to tell a public audience of experts that
the Agency was aware of instances when hackers had done exactly that. Although Tom didnâ t
say where hackers had caused a blackout as part of a criminal scheme, it was later revealed that
the incident took place in Brazil.
The 2003 blackout lasted a few long hours for most people, but even without anyone trying to
prolong the effect it lasted four days in some places. In Auckland, New Zealand, in 1998 the
damage from overloading power lines triggered a blackout and kept the city in the dark for five
weeks. If a control system sends too much power down a high-tension line, the line itself can be
destroyed and initiate a fire. In the process, however, the surge of power can overwhelm home
and office surge protectors and fry electronic devices, computers to televisions to refrigerators,
as happened recently in my rural county during a lightning storm.
The best example, however, of how computer commands can cause things to destroy
themselves may be electric generators. Generators make electricity by spinning, and the number
of times they spin per minute creates power in units expressed in a measurement called Hertz. In
the United States and Canada, the generators on most subgrids spin at 60 Megahertz. When a
generator is started, it is kept off the grid until it gets up to 60 MHz. If it is connected to the grid
at another speed, or if its speed changes very much while on the grid, the power from all of the
other generators on the grid spinning at 60 MHz will flow into the slower generator, possibly
ripping off its turbine blades.
To test whether a cyber warrior could destroy a generator, a federal government lab in Idaho
set up a standard control network and hooked it up to a generator. In the experiment,
code-named Aurora, the testâ s hackers made it into the control network from the Internet and
found the program that sends rotation speeds to the generator. Another keystroke and the
generator could have severely damaged itself. Like so much else, the enormous generators that
power the United States are manufactured when they are ordered, on the just-in-time delivery
principle. They are not sitting around, waiting to be sold. If a big generator is badly damaged or
destroyed, it is unlikely to be replaced for months.
Fortunately, the Federal Electric Regulatory Agency in 2008 finally required electric
companies to adopt some specific cyber security measures and warned that it would fine
companies for noncompliance up to one million dollars a day. No one has been fined yet. The
companies have until sometime in 2010 to comply. Then the commission promises it will begin to
inspect some facilities to determine if they are compliant. Unfortunately, President Obamaâ s
â  Smart Gridâ initiative will cause the electric grid to become even more wired, even more
dependent upon computer network technology.
The same way that a hand can reach out from cyberspace and destroy an electric transmission
line or generator, computer commands can derail a train or send freight cars to the wrong place,
or cause a gas pipeline to burst. Computer commands to a weapon system may cause it to
malfunction or shut off. What a cyber warrior can do, then, is to reach out from cyberspace,
causing things to shut down or blow up, things like the power grid, or a thousand other critical
systems, things like an opponentâ s weapons.
The design of the Internet, flaws in software and hardware, and allowing critical machines to
Page 51
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
be controlled from cyberspace, together, these three things make cyber war possible. But why
havenâ t we fixed these problems by now?

CHAPTER FOUR
THE DEFENSE FAILS
Thus far we have seen evidence that there have been â  trial runsâ at cyber war, mostly using primitive
denial of service attacks. We have seen how the United States, China, Russia, and others are investing
heavily in cyber war units. We have imagined what the first few minutes of a devastating, full-scale cyber
attack on the U.S. would look like. And we have walked through what it is about cyber technology and
its uses that makes such a devastating attack possible.
Why hasnâ t anybody done anything to fix these vulnerabilities? Why are we placing such emphasis on
our ability to attack others, rather than giving priority to defending ourselves against such an attack?
People have tried to create a cyber war defense for the U.S. Obviously they have not succeeded. In this
chapter weâ ll review what efforts have been made to defend against cyber war (and cyber crime, and
cyber espionage) and see why they have been such an unmitigated failure. Strap yourself in, we are first
going to move quickly through twenty years of efforts in the U.S. to do something about cyber security.
Then we will talk about why it hasnâ t worked.
INITIAL THOUGHTS AT THE PENTAGON
In the early 1990s the Pentagon began to worry about the vulnerability created by reliance on new
information systems to conduct warfare. In 1994, something called the â  Joint Security Commissionâ that
was set up by DoD and the intelligence community focused on the new problem introduced by the
spread of networked technology. The commissionâ s final report got three important concepts right:
ï· â  Information systems technologyâ ¦is evolving at a faster rate than information
systems security technology.â
ï· â  The security of information systems and networks [is] the major security
challenge of this decade and possibly the next century andâ ¦there is insufficient
awareness of the grave risks we face in this arena.â
ï· The report also noted that the increased dependence in the private sector on
information systems made the nation as a whole, not just the Pentagon, more
vulnerable.
These three points are all true and even more relevant today. A prescient Time magazine
article from 1995 demonstrates the point that cyber war and domestic vulnerabilities were
subjects to which Washington was alerted fifteen years ago. We keep rediscovering this wheel.
In the 1995 story, Colonel Mike Tanksley waxed poetic about how in a future conflict with a
lesser power the United States would force our enemy to submit without our ever having fired a
shot. Using hacker techniques that were then only possible in the movies, Colonel Tanksley
described how Americaâ s cyber warriors would take down the enemyâ s phone system, destroy
the routing system for the countryâ s rail line, issue phony commands to the opposing military, and
take over television and radio broadcasts to flood them with propaganda. In the fantasy scenario
that Tanksley describes, the effect of using these tactics would end the conflict before it even
starts. Time magazine reported that a logic bomb â  would remain dormant in an enemy system
until a predetermined time, when it would come to life and begin eating data. Such bombs could
attack, for example, computers that run a nationâ s air defense system or central bank.â The
article told readers that the CIA had a â  clandestine program that would insert booby-trapped
computer chips into weapons systems that a foreign arms manufacturer might ship to a potentially
hostile countryâ a technique called â chipping.â â A CIA source told the reporters how it was
done, explaining, â  You get into the arms manufacturerâ s supply network, take the stuff off-line
briefly, insert the bug, then let it go to the countryâ ¦. When the weapons system goes into a
hostile situation, everything about it seems to work, but the warhead doesnâ t explode.â
The Time article was a remarkable piece of journalism that captured both complicated
technical issues and the resulting policy problems long before most people in government
understood anything about them. On the cover it asked: â  The U.S. rushes to turn computers into
Page 53
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
tomorrowâ s weapons of destruction. But how vulnerable is the homefront?â That question is as
pertinent today as it was then, and, remarkably, the situation has changed very little. â  An infowar
arms race could be one the US would lose because it is already so vulnerable to such attacks,â
the writers conclude. â  Indeed,â they continue, â  the cyber enhancements that the military is
banking on for its conventional forces may be chinks in Americaâ s armor.â So by the mid-1990s
journalists were seeing that the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies were excited about the
possibility of creating cyber war capabilities, but doing so would create a double-edged sword,
one that could be used against us.
MARCHING INTO THE MARSH
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols woke a lot of people up in 1995. Their inhumane attack in
Oklahoma City, killing children at a day care center and civil servants at their desks, really got to
Bill Clinton. He delivered an especially moving eulogy near the site of the attack. When he came
back to the White House, I met with him, along with other White House staff. He was thinking
conceptually, as he often does. Society was changing. A few people could have significant
destructive power. People were blowing things up in the U.S., not just in the Middle East. What
if the truck bomb had been aimed at the stock market, or the Capitol, or some building whose
importance we didnâ t even recognize? We were becoming a more technological nation, but in
some ways that also was making us a more fragile nation. At the urging of Attorney General Janet
Reno, Clinton appointed a commission to look at our vulnerability as a nation to attacks on
important facilities.
Important facilities got translated into bureaucratese as â  critical infrastructure,â a phrase that
continues, and continues to confuse, today. The new panel got the moniker Presidential
Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (PCCIP). Not surprisingly, then, most people
referred to it using the name of its Chairman, retired Air Force General Robert Marsh. The
Marsh Commission was a full-time endeavor for a large panel and a professional staff. They held
meetings throughout the country and talked to experts in numerous industries, universities, and
government agencies. What they came back with in 1997 was not what we expected. Rather
than focusing on right-wingers like McVeigh and Nichols or al Qaeda terrorists like those who
had attacked the World Trade Center in 1993, Marsh sounded a loud alarm about the Internet.
Noting what was then a recent trend, the Marsh Commission said that important functions from
rail to banking, from electricity to manufacturing were all being connected to the Internet and yet
that network of networks was completely insecure. By hacking from the Internet, an attacker
could shut down or damage â  critical infrastructure.â
Raising the prospect of nation-states creating â  information warâ attack units, Marsh called for
a massive effort to protect the U.S. He identified the chief challenge as being the role of the
private sector, which owned most of what counted as â  critical infrastructure.â Industries were
wary of the government regulating them to promote cyber security. Instead of doing that, Marsh
called for a â  public-private partnership,â heightened awareness, sharing of information, and
research into more secure designs.
I was disappointed, although in time I came to understand that General Marsh was right. As
the senior White House official in charge of security and counterterrorism issues, I had hoped for
a report that would have helped me get the funding and structure I needed to deal with al Qaeda
and others. Instead, Marsh was talking about computers, which was not my job. My close friend
Randy Beers, then Special Assistant to the President for Intelligence and the man who had been
shepherding the Marsh Commission for the White House, walked next door to my office (with its
twenty-foot-high ceiling and great view of the National Mall), plunked himself down in a chair,
and announced, â  You have to take over critical infrastructure. I canâ t do it because of the Clipper
chip.â
The Clipper chip had been a plan, developed in 1993 by NSA, in which the government
would require anyone in the U.S. using encryption to install a chip that would let NSA listen in,
Page 54
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
with a court order. Privacy, civil liberties, and technology interest groups united in vehement
opposition. For some reason, they did not trust that NSA would only listen in when they had a
warrant (which, under George W. Bush, later proved to be true). The Clipper chip got killed by
1996, but it had left a lot of distrust between the growing information technology (IT) industry
and the U.S. intelligence community. Beers, being an intelligence guy, felt he could not gain the
trust of the IT industry. So he dumped it in my lap. Moreover, he had already wired that decision
with the National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, who asked me to write a Presidential
Decision Document stating our policy on the issue, and putting me in charge of it.
The result was a clear statement of the problem and our goal, but within a structure with
limitations that prevented us from achieving it. The problem was that â  because of our military
strength, future enemiesâ ¦may seek to harm usâ ¦with non-traditional attacks on our
infrastructure and information systemsâ ¦capable of significantly harming both our military power
and our economy.â So far so good. The goal was that â  any interruptions or manipulations of
critical functions must be brief, infrequent, manageable, geographically isolated, and minimally
detrimental.â Pretty good stuff.
But how to do it? By the time every agency in government had watered the decision down, it
read: â  The incentives that the market provides are the first choice for addressing the problem of
critical infrastructure protectionâ ¦. [We will consider] regulation only in the event of a material
failure of the marketâ ¦[and even then] agencies will identify alternatives to direct regulation.â I
got a new title in the Decision Document, but it would not fit on a business card: â  National
Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism.â Little wonder the
media used the term â  czarâ no one could remember the real title. The Decision Document made
clear, however, that the czar could not direct anyone to do anything. The Cabinet members had
been adamant about that. No regulation and no decision-making authority meant little potential
for results.
Nonetheless, we set off to work with the private sector and with government agencies. The
more I worked on the issue, the more concerned I became. Marsh had not really been alarmist, I
came to appreciate; he and his commission had actually understated the problem. Our work on
the Y2K computer glitch (the fact that most software could not roll over from 1999 to 2000 and
might, therefore simply freeze up) greatly added to my understanding of just how much everything
was rapidly becoming dependent upon computer-controlled systems and networks connected in
some way to the Internet. In the 2000 federal budget, I was able to add $2 billion for improved
cyber security efforts, but it was a fraction of what was needed.
By 2000, we had developed a National Plan for Information Systems Protection, but there
was still no willingness in the government to attempt to regulate the industries that ran the
vulnerable critical infrastructure. To highlight the ideological correctness of the decision to avoid
regulation, I used the phrase â  eschew regulationâ in the decision document, mimicking Maoist
rhetoric. (Mao had directed, â  dig tunnels deeper, bury food everywhere, eschew hegemonism.â)
No one saw the irony. Nor would the Cabinet departments even do enough to protect their own
networks, as called for in the Presidential Directive. Thus, the plan was toothless. It did,
however, make clear to industry and to the public what the stakes were. Bill Clintonâ s cover
letter left no doubt that the IT revolution had changed how the economy and national defense
were done. From turning on the lights, to calling 911, to boarding an aircraft, we now relied upon
computer-driven systems. A â  concerted attackâ on the computers of an important economic
sector would â  have catastrophic results.â This was not a theoretical potential; rather, â  we know
the threat is real.â Opponents that had relied on â  bombs and bulletsâ could now use â  a
laptopâ ¦[as] a weapon capable ofâ ¦enormous damage.â
I added in a cover letter of my own that â  More than any other nation, America is dependent
upon cyberspace.â Cyber attacks could â  crash electric gridsâ ¦transportation systemsâ ¦financial
institutions. We know other governments are developing that capability.â So were we, but I didnâ 
t say that.

SIX FUNNY NAMES
During those initial years of my focusing on cyber security there were six major incidents that
convinced me that this was a serious problem. First, in 1997, I worked with NSA on a test of the
Pentagonâ s cyber security in an exercise the military called â  Eligible Receiver.â Within two days,
our attack team had penetrated the classified command network and was in position to issue
bogus orders. I stopped the exercise early. The Deputy Defense Secretary was shocked at the
Pentagonâ s vulnerability and ordered all components to buy and install intrusion detection
systems. They quickly discovered that there were thousands of attempts a day to hack into DoD
networks. And those were the ones they knew about.
In 1998, during a crisis with Iraq, someone hacked into the unclassified DoD computers that
were needed to manage the U.S. military buildup. The FBI gave the attack the appropriate name
â  Solar Sunriseâ (it was a wake-up call for many). After a few days of panic, the attackers were
discovered to be not Iraqi but Israeli. Specifically, a teenager in Israel and two more in California
had proved how poorly secured our military logistics network was.
In 1999, an Air Force base noticed something odd about its computer network. The Air
Force called the FBI, which called NSA. What emerged was that huge amounts of data were
being exfiltrated from the research files at the airbase. Indeed, gigantic amounts of data were
being shipped out from a lot of computers in the Defense network and from many data systems in
the national nuclear laboratories of the Energy Department. The FBI case file for this one was
called â  Moonlight Maze,â which also turned out to be apt because no one could throw much light
on what was happening other than to say the data was being sent through a long series of stops in
many countries before ending up somewhere. The two deeply disturbing aspects of this were that
the computer security specialists could not stop the data from being stolen, even when they knew
about the problem, and no one was really sure where it all was going (although some people later
publicly attributed the attack to Russians). Every time new defenses were put in place, the
attacker beat them. Then, one day, the attacks stopped. Or, more likely, they started attacking in
a way we could not see.
Early in 2000, when we were still glowing from our success in avoiding a Y2K problem, a
number of the new Internet commerce sites (AOL, Yahoo, Amazon, E-Trade) crashed from
what I was told was a DDOS, a term new to most people in 2000. This was the first â  big one,â
hitting numerous companies simultaneously and knocking them down. The motive was hard to
discern. There were no monetary demands, nor was there a real political message. Somebody
seemed to be trying out the concept of covertly taking over lots of peopleâ s computers and
secretly using them to attack. (That somebody later turned out to be a busboy from Montreal.) I
saw the DDOS as an opportunity to have the government remind the private sector that they
needed to take cyber attacks seriously.
President Clinton agreed to host the leaders of the companies that had been attacked as well
as other CEOs from important infrastructures and from the IT industry. It was the first
presidential White House meeting with private-sector leadership concerning a cyber attack. It
was also the last, thus far. Although it was a remarkably detailed and frank meeting, eye-opening
for many, it essentially resulted in everyone agreeing to work harder on the problem.
In 2001, the new Bush Administration got a taste of the problem when the Code Red worm
infected over 300,000 computers in a few hours and then turned them all into zombies
programmed to launch a DDOS attack on the White House webpage. I was able to distribute
the White House website onto 20,000 servers using a company called Akamai and thereby
avoided the effects of the attack (we also persuaded some of the major ISPs to divert the attack
traffic). Cleaning up the infected computers turned out to be a harder job. Many companies and
individuals could not be bothered to remove the worm software, despite its repeated disruptive
effects on the Internet. Nor did we have any ability to deny those machines access to the
Internet, even though they were pumping out malware on a regular basis. In the days after the
Page 56
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
9/11 terrorist attack, another, more serious worm spread quickly. The NIMDA (Admin spelled
backward) worm was targeted at computers running in the most well secured private-sector
industry vertical, the financial industry. Despite their sophisticated security, many banks and Wall
Street firms were knocked offline.
CYBER SECURITY GETS BUSHED
The Bush Administration took some convincing that cyber security was an important problem,
but agreed by the summer of 2001 to set up a separate office in the White House to handle its
coordination (Executive Order 13231). I ran that office as Special Advisor to the President for
Cybersecurity from the autumn of 2001 to early 2003. Most of the rest of the Bush White House
(the Science Advisor, the Economic Advisor, the Budget Director) sought to limit the authority of
the new cyber security position.
Unfazed by that, my team took the Clinton National Plan and modified it based on input from
twelve industry teams we established and from citizen input at ten town halls held around the
country. (The kind of crowd that shows up for a cyber security town hall is, thankfully, more
civilized than the nut jobs who showed up in 2009 at health-care town halls.) The result was the
National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, which Bush signed in February 2003. Substantively,
there was little difference between the Clinton and Bush approaches, except that the Republican
administration not only continued to eschew regulation, they downright hated the idea of the
federal government issuing any new regulations on anything at all. Bush left jobs vacant for long
periods at several regulatory commissions and then appointed commissioners who did not
enforce the regulations that did exist.
Bushâ s personal understanding and interest in cyber security early in his administration were
best summed up by a question he asked me in 2002. I had gone to him in the Oval Office with
news of a discovery of a pervasive flaw in software, a flaw that would allow hackers to run amok
unless we could quietly persuade most major networks and corporations to fix the flaw. Bushâ s
only reaction was: â  What does John think?â John was the CEO of a large information-technology
company and a major donor to the Bush election committee.
With the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, I had thought there would be an
opportunity to take many of the scattered entities working on cyber security and merge them into
one center of excellence. As a result, some cyber security offices from the Commerce
Department, FBI, and DoD were brought together in Homeland. The sum turned out to be much
less than the parts, as many of the best people in the merged offices took the opportunity to leave
government. When I also took my exit from the Bush Administration shortly before it began the
disastrous Iraq War, the White House chose not to replace me as Special Advisor. The most
senior official in government charged with coordinating cyber security was then in an office buried
several layers down in what was turning into the most dysfunctional department in government,
DHS. Several very good people tried to make that job work, but each one quit in frustration.
The media began talking about the â  cyber czar of the week.â The high-level private-sector focus
on the issue we had achieved faded.
Four years later, Bush made a decision much more quickly than his staff had assumed he
would. There was a covert action that the President had to approve personally. The Presidentâ s
scheduler had booked an hour for the decision briefing. It took five minutes. Bush never saw a
covert-action proposal he didnâ t like. Now, with fifty-five minutes left in the meeting, the Director
of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, saw an opening. All the right people were in the room,
senior national security cabinet members. McConnell asked if he could discuss a threat to the
financial industry and the U.S. economy. Given the floor, he talked about cyber war and how
vulnerable we were to it. Particularly vulnerable was the financial sector, which would not know
how to recover from a data-shredding attack, an attack that could do unimaginable damage to
the economy. Stunned, Bush turned to Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, who agreed with the
assessment.
Page 57
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
At this point, Bush, who had been sitting behind the large desk in the Oval Office, almost
jumped in the air. He moved quickly to the front of the desk and began gesturing for emphasis as
he spoke. â  Information technology is supposed to be our advantage, not our weakness. I want
this fixed. I want a plan, soon, real soon.â The result was the Comprehensive National
Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) and National Security Presidential Decision 54. Neither has ever
become public. Both documents call, appropriately enough, for a twelve-step plan. They focus,
however, on securing the governmentâ s networks. Oddly, the plan did not address the problem
that had started the discussion in the Oval Office, the vulnerability of the financial sector to cyber
war.
Nonetheless, Bush requested $50 billion over five years for the Comprehensive National
Cybersecurity Initiative, which is neither comprehensive nor national. The initiative is an effort to,
in the words of one knowledgeable insider, â  stop the bleedingâ out of DoD and
intelligence-community systems, with a secondary focus on the rest of the government. Also
described as a multibillion-dollar â  patch and pray program,â the initiative does not address
vulnerabilities in the private sector, including in our critical infrastructures. That tougher problem
was left to the next administration.
The initiative was also supposed to develop an â  information warfare deterrence strategy and
declaratory doctrine.â That part has almost totally been put on hold. In May 2008, the Senate
Armed Services Committee criticized the initiativeâ s secrecy in a public report, with the comment
that â  it is difficult to conceive how the United States could promulgate a meaningful deterrence
doctrine if every aspect of our capabilities and operational concepts is classified.â Reading that, I
could not help but think of Dr. Strangelove when, in the movie of the same name, he berates the
Soviet Ambassador for Moscowâ s keeping the existence of its nuclear-deterrent Doomsday
Machine a secret: â  Of course, the whole point of a Doomsday Machine is lost if you keep it a
secret! Why didnâ t you tell the world?â The reason we are keeping our cyber deterrence
strategy secret is probably that we do not have a good one.
OBAMAâ S OVERFLOWING PLATE
It was another vulnerability of the financial sector, brought on as a result of industry successfully
lobbying against government regulation, that Barack Obama was forced to focus on when he
became President in 2009. The subprime-mortgage meltdown and the complex dealings in the
derivatives markets had created the worst financial crisis since 1929. With that, in addition to the
war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, threatening flu pandemics, health-care reform, and global
warming all requiring his attention, Obama did not focus on cyber security. He had, however,
addressed the issue during the 2008 campaign. Although I had signed on to the campaign as a
terrorism advisor, I used that access to pester the candidate and his advisors about cyber war. It
was not surprising to me that Obama â  gotâ the issue, since he was running the most
technologically advanced, cyber-dependent presidential campaign in history.
Thus, as part of the campaignâ s effort to stake out some ground on national security issues,
then-Senator Obama gave a speech and met with national experts on technology and emerging
threats at Purdue University in the summer of 2008. In the speech, he took the bold step of
declaring U.S. cyber infrastructure â  a strategic asset,â an important phrase in government-speak
that means it is something worth defending. He also pledged to appoint a senior White House
advisor who would report directly to him and gave a general commitment to make cyber security
â  a top federal priority.â In the accompanying fact sheet, which my coauthor Rob Knake drafted
along with two MIT computer scientists, John Mallery and Roger Hurwitz, he went a step
further, criticizing the Bush Administration for moving too slowly in the face of the risks
associated with cyberspace, and pledging to initiate a â  Safe Computing R&D effortâ to â  develop
next-generation secure computers and networking for national security applications,â to invest
more in science and math education, and to create plans to address private-sector vulnerabilities,
identity theft, and corporate espionage.
Page 58
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
A few weeks later, the cyber threat was hammered home to Obama in a very serious way.
The FBI quietly informed the campaign that it had reason to believe Chinese hackers had
infiltrated the campaignâ s computer systems. I asked one of my business partners, Paul Kurtz
(who had worked on cyber security on both the Clinton and Bush White House staffs), to take a
team of cyber security experts out to the Chicago headquarters to assess the extent of the
damage and see what could be done to secure the systems. The Chinese hackers had focused on
draft policy documents. They had used some sophisticated techniques, hidden beneath more
obvious activity.
When the campaign quietly put together an unofficial transition team weeks before election
day, I asked everyone working on national security planning to stop using their home computers
for that purpose. Even though what they were writing was unclassified, it was of interest to China
and others (including, presumably, John McCain, not that his campaign had shown much
understanding of cyber technology). With the campaignâ s blessing, we distributed â  cleanâ Apple
laptops and locked them down so they could only connect to one thing, a virtual private network
we created using a server with a completely innocuous name. I knew we were going to be in
trouble when I started getting calls complaining about the security features. â  Dick, Iâ m at a
Starbucks and this damn machine wonâ t let me connect to the wi-fi.â â  Dick, I want to pull some
files off of my Gmail account, but I canâ t access the Internet.â I tried to point out that if you are a
senior member of the informal national security transition team, you probably should not be
planning the takeover of the White House from a Starbucks, but not everyone seemed to care.
Shortly before the inauguration, Paul Kurtz and I provided the new White House team with a
draft decision document to formalize the proposals Obama had advocated in the Purdue speech.
We argued that if Obama waited, people would come out of the woodwork to try to stop it.
Although the most senior White House staff understood that problem and wanted a quick
decision, it was, understandably, not a high priority for them. Instead, the new Obama White
House announced a Sixty Day Review and asked one of the drafters of Bushâ s CNCI to run it.
This was despite the fact that Jim Lewis and the Commission on Cyber Security for the
forty-fourth Presidency had already spent over a year working to achieve a consensus view on
what the next President needed to do, releasing their report on December 8, 2008. When, 110
days later, the President announced the results, guess what? It was CNCI redux. It also had a
military Cyber Command, but not a cyber war strategy, not a major policy or program to defend
the private sector, nothing to initiate international dialogue on cyber war. And, dÃ©jÃ  vu all over
again, the new Democratic President went out of his way to take regulation off the table: â  So let
me be very clear: my administration will not dictate security standards for private companies.â
What Obama did not announce in his public remarks after the Sixty Day Review was who
would be the new White House cyber security czar. Few qualified people wanted the job, largely
because it had no apparent authority and had been altered to report directly to both the
Economic Advisor and the National Security Advisor. The Economic Advisor was the ousted
former Harvard president Larry Summers, who had made it clear that he thought the private
sector and market forces would do enough to deal with the cyber war threat without any
additional government regulation or role in their affairs. Months went by during which the best
efforts of the White House personnel office failed to convince candidate after candidate that this
was a job worth taking.
Thus, for the first year of his administration, Obama had no one in the White House trying to
orchestrate a government-wide, integrated cyber security or cyber war program. Departments
and agencies did their own thing, or did nothing. The two lead agencies in defending America
from cyber war were U.S. Cyber Command (to defend the military) and the Department of
Homeland Security (to defend, well, something else). The head of U.S. Cyber Command kept a
low profile for most of 2009 because the Senate had not yet agreed to give him his fourth star.
To get the promotion from three stars, General Keith Alexander would have to answer questions
before a Senate committee, and that committee wasnâ t too sure it understood what U.S. Cyber
Page 59
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Command was actually supposed to do. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan asked the Pentagon to
send over an explanation of the commandâ s mission and strategy before he would agree to
schedule a confirmation hearing.
While Senator Levin was trying to figure out what Cyber Command was supposed to be
protecting and General Alexander was â  in the quiet periodâ before his hearing, I wasnâ t too clear
on what Homeland Security was supposed to protect. Therefore I went to the source and asked
Secretary Janet Napolitano. She graciously agreed to meet with me at her departmentâ s
headquarters. Unlike other cabinet departments, which tend to be headquartered in monumental
edifices or modern office blocks near the National Mall, the newest department is run from a
barbed-wire-enclosed encampment in northwest Washington, D.C. Behind the wire are a series
of low-rise redbrick buildings that, seen from the street, appear like a Nazi army kaserne. It is
little wonder that when civil servants were forced to move in they gave the place the nickname
Stalag 13, after the fictional German prison camp in the long-running television comedy show 
Hoganâ s Heroes.
In fact, the facility had been the headquarters of the U.S. Navyâ s cryptographical service, the
predecessor of the new 10th Fleet. Like U.S. Navy bases everywhere, this one came with a little
white church and cute little street signs. One street is named â  Intelligence Way.â To get to the
Secretaryâ s office, we walked through a seemingly endless sea of gray Dilbert cubicles.
Napolitanoâ s personal office was only slightly better. For the former Governor of Arizona, the
dismal ten-by-twelve-foot office was a distinct comedown. Nonetheless, she had managed to
cram a bronco-busting saddle into one corner. But the place had a temporary feel to it, six years
after the department had been created. â  Weâ re moving to a big new headquarters,â the Secretary
explained, trying to emphasize the positive. The new headquarters, on the grounds of St.
Elizabethâ s, Washington, D.C.â s shuttered insane asylum, would be ready in year ten of the
departmentâ s existence, maybe.
â  Even though the government was closed for a holiday yesterday, I spent it meeting with
executives form the financial sector, talking to them about cyber security,â Napolitano began. It
was Cyber Security Awareness Month at the department and she had scheduled a number of
events. I asked her what the greatest cyber security threat was. â  The highly skilled lone hacker,
cyber criminal cartelsâ ¦â she replied. Well, what if there were a cyber war, I asked. â  The
Pentagon would have the lead in a war, but we would do consequence management of any
damage in the U.S.â What about preventing the damage so that there would be fewer
consequences to manage? â  We are growing the capability so that we might be able to protect the
dot-gov domain.
Well, if U.S. Cyber Command is protecting dot-mil and you will one day protect dot-gov,
who is protecting everything else, like the critical infrastructure, which is in the private sector?
â  We work with the private sector groups, the Information Sharing and Analysis Centers in the
eighteen critical industries, to share information with them.â That is not the same thing as the U.S.
government protecting the critical infrastructure from cyber war attacks, is it? No, the Secretary
admitted, it wasnâ t. Doing that, she suggested, was not Homeland Securityâ s job.
Homeland Security is developing a system to scan cyber traffic going to and from federal
departments, looking for malware (viruses, worms, etc.). The immodestly named â  Einsteinâ
system had grown from mere traffic flow monitoring (Einstein 1) to intrusion and malware
detection (Einstein 2) and will soon attempt to block Internet packets that appear to be malware
(Einstein 3). As part of the effort to defend the government sites, Homeland and the General
Services Administration are attempting to reduce the number of portals from the Internet to the
dot-gov domain. Then Homeland will place Einstein 3 on each of those portals into dot-gov to
scan for malware. The Einstein network will be run by Homelandâ s newly consolidated cyber
security division, the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center in Ballston,
Virginia.
If DHS can get this to work, I asked, why just limit it to protecting the federal government?
Page 60
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
â  Well, we may want to look later on at taking it out more broadly.â Secretary Napolitano, who is
a lawyer and a former federal prosecutor, added that there would be legal and privacy hurdles to
having the government scanning the public Internet for cyber war attacks. Well, then, could she
employ regulatory authority to make critical infrastructure improve their own ability to defend
from cyber war attacks, and to regulate the ISPs or the electric power companies? To her credit,
Secretary Napolitano did not rule those possibilities out either, even though President Obama
himself had seemed to in his cyber security speech in May 2009. But regulation, she noted,
would come only after information sharing and voluntary measures had been shown to fail, and in
year one of the Obama Administration it was too early to make that judgment. Of course,
information sharing and voluntary measure approach had been tried for over a decade.
What was within her responsibilities was to secure the dot-gov domain, and Napolitano was
pleased to report that DHS was looking for one thousand new employees with cyber security
skills. Immediately critics wondered publicly why highly qualified cyber geeks would want to
work for Homeland when everyone from Cyber Command to Lockheed and Bank of America
was recruiting them. Napolitano said she was working to get the personnel rules changed so that
she could pay salaries competitive with the private sector, and she was looking into creating
satellite offices in California and other places away from Washington where geeks â  might prefer
to live.â I thought I heard in her voice the longing for back home that many in the Washington
bureaucracy secretly harbor. As we left the Secretaryâ s office, the head of the U.S. Coast
Guard, Admiral Thad Allen, was waiting outside. â  Glad to see you survived the interview with
Dick,â the Admiral joked. â  I survived,â the Secretary replied, â  but now Iâ m depressed about
cyber war.â
Why had Clinton, Bush, and then Obama failed to deal successfully with the problem posed
by Americaâ s private-sector vulnerability to cyber war? People who have worked on this issue
for years all have slightly different answers, or differences in emphasis. Letâ s explore six of the
reasons they most often give.
1. THE GREATEST TRICK
The first reason you hear is that many cyber attacks that have happened have left behind no
marks, no gaping crater like Manhattanâ s Ground Zero. When private-sector firms have their
core intellectual property stolen, they usually donâ t even know it happened. To understand the
problem that creates, imagine that you work in a museum with valuable objects, letâ s say
sculptures and paintings. When you leave the museum at the end of the day, you turn on an alarm
system and make sure that the video recorder is running and is connected to the surveillance
cameras. In the morning, you return. The alarm has not gone off overnight, but just to be sure,
you scan through the video of the last twelve hours and satisfy yourself that no one was inside the
museum while you were gone. Finally, you check all the sculptures and paintings to be sure that
they are still there. All is well. Why ever would you then think you had a security problem?
That is essentially the situation that the Pentagon was facing in the late 1990s and continues to
face today. There may be some low-level activity of people trying to penetrate their networks,
but doesnâ t the security software (firewalls, intrusion-detection systems, intrusion-prevention
systems) deal effectively with most of the threats? Why would the brass think that their intellectual
property, their crown jewels, war plans, engineering drawings, or software was now residing on
hard drives in China, Russia, or anywhere other than just on their systems?
The difference between art thieves and world-class hackers is that with the best of the cyber
thieves, you never know you were a victim. â  Hell, the U.S. government does [number withheld]
penetrations of foreign networks every month,â one intelligence official told me. â  We never get
caught. If we are not getting caught, what arenâ t we catching when weâ re guarding our own?â
How do you convince someone that they have a problem when there is no evidence you can give
them? The data isnâ t missing like the Vermeer that was snatched from the Isabella Stewart
Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990. This sounds like a new problem, unique to cyberspace.

Historians of military intelligence, however, have heard this tale before.
In the Cold War the United States Navy was confident that it could defeat the Soviet naval
forces if it ever came to a shooting war, until they learned that a family of Americans had given
the Soviets a unique advantage. The Walker family, including an employee at the National
Security Agency and his son in the U.S. Navy, had supplied the Soviets with the Navyâ s
top-secret codes, the cryptology that scrambled and unscrambled messages to and from our
ships. The Red Navy knew where our ships were, where they were going, what they were
ordered to do, and which major weapons and other systems onboard were not working. We
were unaware that the Soviets knew these things because, although we assumed that they were
intercepting our message traffic coming over radio frequencies, we were very confident that they
could never unscramble our code. They probably never could have, until they bought the
descrambling key from some trusted Americans.
The U.S. Navyâ s smug arrogance about the security of its Cold War codes was hardly unique
in the history of code-breaking: the Japanese thought that no one could read their naval codes
during World War II, but the United States and the United Kingdom were doing just that. Some
historians believe that the U.S. Navy defeated the Imperial Japanese Navy precisely because of
code-breaking skills. Certainly the decisive U.S. victory in the Battle of Midway was due to the
advanced knowledge of Japanese plans gained from code-breaking. It is a reasonable
assumption that over several decades many nationsâ  codes, presumed to be unbreakable by their
users, were (or are) actually being read by others.
Even though historians and national security officials know that there are numerous precedents
for institutions thinking their communications are secure when they are not, there is still resistance
to believing that it may be happening now, and to us. American military leaders today cannot
conceive of the possibility that their Secret (SIPRNET) or Top Secret intranet (JWICS) is
compromised, but several experts I spoke to are convinced that it is. Many corporate leaders
also believe that the millions of dollars they have spent on computer security systems means they
have successfully protected their companyâ s secrets. After all, if anybody had gotten inside their
secret files, the intrusion detection system software would have sounded an alarm. Right?
No, not necessarily. And even if the alarm did go off, in many cases that would not have
caused anyone to do anything very quickly in response. There are ways of penetrating networks
and assuming the role of the network administrator or other authorized user without ever doing
anything that would cause an alarm. Moreover, if an alarm does go off, it is often such a routine
occurrence on a large network that nothing will happen in response. Perhaps the next day
someone will check the logs and notice that a couple of terabytes of information were
downloaded and transmitted outside of the network to some compromised server, the first stop
on a multistage trip intended to obscure the final destination. Or, perhaps, no one will notice that
anything ever happened. The priceless art is still on the museum walls. And if that is the case, why
should the government or the bottom-line-conscious executive do anything?
I mentioned in chapter 2 the 2003 phenomenon code-named Titan Rain. Alan Paller, a friend
who runs the SANS Institute, a cyber security education and advocacy group, described what
happened on one afternoon in that case, November 1, 2003.
At 10:23 p.m. the Titan Rain hackers exploited vulnerabilities at the U.S. Army Information
Systems Engineering Command at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.
At 1:19 a.m. they exploited the same hole in computers at the Defense Information Systems
Agency in Arlington, Virginia.
At 3:25 a.m. they hit the Naval Ocean Systems Center, a Defense Department installation in
San Diego, California.
At 4:46 a.m. they struck the U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense installation in Huntsville,
Alabama.
There were lots of days like that. Not only were Defense facilities hit, but terabytes of sensitive
information left NASA labs, as well as the computers of corporations such as Lockheed Martin
Page 62
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
and Northrop Grumman, which have been given contracts worth billions of dollars to manage
security for DoD networks. Cyber security staffs tried to figure out the techniques being used to
penetrate the networks. And their blocking efforts seemed to work. One participant in these
defensive efforts told us that â  Everyone was all self-congratulatory.â He shook his head, pulled a
grimace, and added softly, â  â ¦till they realized that the attacker had just gone all stealthy, but was
probably still stealing us blind. We just couldnâ t see it anymore.â The case names Moonlight
Maze and Titan Rain are now best thought of as fleeting glimpses of a much broader campaign,
most of which went unseen. It may seem somewhat incredible that terabytes of information can
be removed from a companyâ s network without that company being able to stop it all from going
out the door. In the major cases we know about, the companies or federal organizations usually
did not even detect that an exfiltration of data had occurred until well after it had taken place. All
of these victims had intrusion-detection systems that are supposed to alarm when an unauthorized
intruder attempts to get on a network. Some sites even had the more advanced intrusionprevention systems, which not only alarm but also automatically take steps to block an intruder.
The alarms remained silent. If you have a mental image of every interesting lab, company, and
research facility in the U.S. being systematically vacuum cleaned by some foreign entity, youâ ve
got it right. That is what has been going on. Much of our intellectual property as a nation has been
copied and sent overseas. Our best hope is that whoever is doing this does not have enough
analysts to go through it all and find the gems, but that is a faint hope, particularly if the country
behind the hacks has, say, a billion people in it.
One bright spot in this overall picture of data going out the door unhindered is what happened
at Johns Hopkins Universityâ s Advanced Physics Laboratory (APL), outside Baltimore. APL
does hundreds of millions of dollars of research every year for the U.S. government, from
outer-space technology to biomedicine to secret â  national securityâ projects. APL did discover in
2009 that it had huge amounts of data being secretly exfiltrated off its network and they stopped
it. What is very telling is the way in which they stopped it. APL is one of the places that is really
expert in cyber security and has contracts with the National Security Agency. So one might think
that they were able to get their intrusion systems to block the data theft. No. The only way in
which these cyber experts were able to prevent their network from being pillaged was to
disconnect the organization from the Internet. APL pulled the plug and isolated its entire network,
making it an island in cyberspace. For weeks, APLâ s experts went throughout the network,
machine by machine, attempting to discover trapdoors and other malware. So the state of the art
in really insuring that your data does not get copied right off your network appears to be to make
sure that you are in no way connected to anybody. Even that turns out to be harder than it may
seem. In large organizations, people innocently make connections to their home computers, to
laptops with wi-fi connections, to devices like photocopiers that have their own connectivity
through the Internet. If you are connected to the Internet in any way, it seems, your data is
already gone.
The really good cyber hackers, including the best government teams from countries such as the
U.S. and Russia, are seldom stumped when trying to penetrate a network, even if its operators
think the network is not connected in any way to the public Internet. Furthermore, the varsity
teams do something that causes network defenders to sound like paranoids. They never leave
any marks that they were there, except when they want you to know. Think of Kevin Spaceyâ s
characterâ s line in the movie The Usual Suspects: â  The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was
convincing the world he didnâ t exist.â
2. VEGAS, BABY
Another reason given for why there has not been a groundswell sufficient to address Americaâ s
vulnerability to cyber war is that the â  thought leadershipâ group in the field canâ t agree on what to
do. To test that hypothesis, I went in search of the â  thought leadersâ in what you might think was
one of the more unlikely places to find them, Caesars Palace, in Las Vegas, in the 104-degree
Page 63
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
heat of August 2009.
Caesars is an incongruous site on any day, filled as it is with statues and symbols of an empire
that fell over fifteen centuries ago scattered among blinking slot machines and blackjack tables.
At Caesars, conference rooms with names like the Colosseum and the Palatine are not crumbling
ruins, but are state-of-the-art meeting facilities, with white boards, flat screens, and flashing
control consoles. Every summer for the past dozen years, when the more mainstream
conventions wrap up the Vegas conference season and the room prices drop, a slightly different
kind of crowd descends on the Strip. They are mainly men, usually in shorts and T-shirts, often
with backpacks, BlackBerrys, and Mac laptops. Few of them drop into the fashion-forward
Hugo Boss, Zegna, or HermÃ¨s shops in Caesars Forum, but they have almost all been to the 
Star Trek show over at the Hilton. The crowd are hackers, and in 2009 over four thousand of
them showed up for the Black Hat conference, enough information technology skill in one place
to wage cyber war on a massive scale.
Despite the name, Black Hat is actually now a gathering of â  white hat,â or â  ethical,â hackers,
people who are or work for chief information officers (CIOs) or chief information security
officers (CISOs) at banks, pharmaceutical firms, universities, government agencies, almost every
imaginable kind of large (and many medium-sized) company. The name Black Hat derives from
the fact that the highlights of the show every year are announcements by hackers that theyâ ve
figured out new ways to make popular software applications do things they were not designed to
do. The software companies used to think of the conference as a meeting of bad guys. Usually
the demonstrations show that softwareâ s writers were not sufficiently security conscious, with the
result that there is a way to penetrate a computer network without authorization, maybe even gain
control of a network.
Microsoft was the butt of the conferenceâ s hacking for years, and the executives in Redmond
looked forward annually to Black Hat the way most of us anticipate a tax audit. In 2009 the
attention turned to Apple, because of the increasing popularity of its products. The
most-discussed demonstration concerned how to hack an iPhone with a simple SMS text
message. As much as Bill Gates, or now maybe even Steve Jobs, might like it to be illegal for
people to find and publicize the flaws in their products, it is not a crime to do so. A crime occurs
only when a hacker uses the method heâ s developed (the â  exploitâ) to utilize the flaw heâ s
discovered in the software (the â  vulnerabilityâ) to get him into a corporate or government
network (â  the targetâ) where he is not authorized to be. Of course, once a vulnerability is
publicized at Black Hat, or, worse yet, once an exploit is disseminated, anyone can attack any
network running the flawed software.
I got into a little bit of trouble in 2002 for suggesting in my Black Hat keynote address that it
was a good thing that hackers were discovering flaws in software. I was Special Advisor for
Cyber Security to President Bush at the time. Someone, presumably in Redmond, thought it
wrong for a nice conservative Republican White House to be encouraging illegal acts. Of course,
what I actually said was that when the ethical hackers discovered flaws they should first tell the
software maker, and then, if they got no response, call the government. Only if the software
maker refused to fix the problem, I said, should the hackers go public. My logic was that if the
hackers at Black Hat could discover the software flaws, China, Russia, and others probably
could, too. Since those engaged in espionage and crime would find out anyway, it was better if
everyone else knew. Public knowledge of a â  bugâ in software would probably mean two things:
(1) most sensitive networks would stop using the software until it got fixed, and (2) the software
manufacturer would be shamed into fixing it, or pressured to do so by its paying customers, such
as banks and the Pentagon.
Comments like that did not endear me to certain corporate interests. They also didnâ t like it
when, again in 2002, I was the keynote speaker at the annual RSA conference. The RSA
conference is a gathering of about 12,000 cyber security practitioners. It is an occasion for many
late-night parties. My keynote was early in the morning. I was standing backstage, thinking about
Page 64
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
how I needed more coffee. The band Kansas had been brought in and was playing loudly in the
big hall. When they were done, I was supposed to walk out onstage through a cloud of theatrical
smoke. You get the picture. Thinking of my caffeine needs, I noted shortly after starting the
speech that a recent survey had shown that many large companies spent more money on free
coffee for their employees and guests than they did on cyber security. To which I added, â  If youâ 
re a big company and spend more on coffee than on cyber security, you will be hacked.â Pause.
Then go for it. â  Whatâ s more, if those are your priorities, you deserve to be hacked.â Dozens of
irate telephone calls from corporate officials followed.
RSA is very corporate. Black hat is a lot more fun. The thrill at Black Hat is going into a dimly
lit ballroom and seeing someone unaccustomed to public speaking projecting lines of code on a
presentation screen. Hotel staff servicing the conference always look quizzical when a meeting
room erupts in laughter or applause, which they do a lot, because to the average person nothing
is being said that is obviously humorous, praiseworthy, or for that matter even understandable.
Perhaps the only thing that most Americans would generally follow if they wandered off course
into Black Hat while looking for the roulette tables is the conferenceâ s Hacker Court, mock trials
with judges who seek to establish what sort of hacking should really be considered unethical.
Apparently hacking the hackers is not in that category. Most conferencegoers just accept that
they should have their wi-fi applications turned off on their laptops. Signs throughout the vast
conference area note that the wi-fi network should be considered â  a hostile environment.â The
warning is about as necessary as a placard at an aquarium noting that there is no lifeguard on duty
in the shark tank.
In 2009, conference organizer Jeff Moss broke with tradition by scheduling one meeting at
Black Hat Vegas that was not open to all attendees. Indeed, Moss, who dressed only in black
during the conference, limited the attendance at that meeting to thirty people, instead of the usual
500 to 800 who crowd each of the six simultaneous sessions that take place five or more times a
day during the conference. The invitation-only session was populated by a group of â  old hands,â
people who knew where the virtual bodies were buried in cyberspace: former government
officials, current bureaucrats, chief security officers in major corporations, academics, and senior
IT company officials. Mossâ s question to them: What do we want the new Obama
Administration to do to secure cyberspace? In a somewhat unorthodox move, the Obama
Administration had placed Moss on the Homeland Security Advisory Board, so there was some
chance that his reporting of the groupâ s consensus views would be heard, assuming the group
could strike a consensus.
To their surprise, the group reached general accord on a few things, as well as polarized
disagreement on others. Where the consensus emerged was around five points. First, the group
was all in favor of returning to the days when the federal government spent a lot on cyber security
research and development. The agency that had done so, and which had also funded the creation
of the Internet, DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), had essentially
abandoned the Internet security field during the Bush (43) Administration and instead focused
attention on â  netcentric warfare,â apparently oblivious that such combat depended upon
cyberspace being secure.
Second, there was a slight majority in favor of â  smart regulationâ of some aspects of cyber
security, like maybe federal guidelines for the Internet backbone carriers. The smart part was the
idea of government regulators specifying goals, rather than micromanaging by dictating means.
Most thought, however, that the well-entrenched interest groups in Washington would
successfully lobby Congress to block any regulation in this area. Third, the group thought
worrying about who did cyber attacks, the so-called attribution problem, was fruitless and that
people should instead focus on â  resilience.â Resilience is the concept that accepts that a
disruptive or even destructive attack will occur and advocates planning in advance for how to
recover from such devastation.
The fourth consensus observation was that there really should be no connectivity between
Page 65
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
utility networks and the Internet. The idea of separating â  critical infrastructureâ from the
open-to-anyone Internet seemed pretty obvious to the seasoned group of information security
specialists. In a ballroom down the hall, however, the Obama Administrationâ s ideas about a
Smart Electric Grid were being flayed by several hundred other security specialists, precisely
because the plans would make the electric power grid, that sine qua non for all the other
infrastructure, even more vulnerable to unauthorized penetration and disruption from the
anonymous creatures who prowl the Internet.
The final point on which the â  wise menâ (including three women) were able to generally agree
was that nothing would happen to solve the woes of cyberspace security until someone showed
what is so lacking now: leadership. This observation apparently did not seem ironic to the group,
who, arguably, were the leaders of the elite information technology security specialists in the
country. Yet they looked to the Obama Administration for leadership in the area. At that point
the Obama White House had already called over thirty people to see if they were interested in
being the administrationâ s leader on cyberspace security. The search went on in Washington, as
did the demonstrations down the hall of how to hack systems. As the â  thought leadersâ
wandered out of the Pompeii Room somewhat dejected, hoping for leadership, they could hear
erupting, probably from the Vesuvius Room, the sound of hundreds wailing as a hacker virtually
sliced apart another iPhone. We did not rush over to see what application had been hacked.
Instead, we went off to the blackjack tables, where the odds of our losing seemed less than those
for American companies and government agencies hoping to stay safe in cyberspace.
3. PRIVACY AND THE R WORD
When both the left and the right disagree with your solution to a problem, you know two things:
(1) you are probably on the correct path, and (2) you stand almost no chance of getting your
solution adopted. Many of the things that have to be done to reduce Americaâ s vulnerability to
cyber war are anathema to one or the other end of the political spectrum. That is why they have
not been embraced thus far.
I will discuss the details of what might be done in the next chapter, but I can tell you now that
some of the ideas will require regulation and some will have the potential, if abused, to violate
privacy. In Washington, one might as well advocate random forced abortions as suggest new
regulation or create any greater privacy risks.
My position on regulation is that it is neither good nor bad inherently; it depends upon what the
regulation says. Complex, 1960s-style federal regulations generally serve only the Washington
law firms where they are written, and where policies to avoid them are devised at $1,000 an
hour. â  Smart regulation,â as discussed at Black Hat, articulates an end state and allows the
regulated to figure out how best to get to it. Regulation that puts a U.S. company at an economic
disadvantage to a foreign competitor is usually unwise, but a regulatory even playing field that
passes on minimal costs to users does not seem to me to be one of the works of Satan.
Regulations where compliance is not audited or enforced are worthless, almost as troubling as
regulations requiring the hovering presence of federal officials. Third-party audits and remote
compliance verification generally seem like sensible approaches. Refusal to regulate, or audit, or
enforce, often results in things like the 2008 market crash and recession, or lead paint in childrenâ 
s toys. Overregulation sometimes creates artificially high consumer prices and requirements that
do little or nothing to solve the original problem, and suppresses creativity and innovation.
On privacy rights, and civil liberties in general, I am far more categorical. We need to be
vigilant, lest government erode our rights. This is not an unjustified fear. Well-meaning provisions
of the Patriot Act were abused in recent years. Other restrictions on government action, including
those in the Bill of Rights and in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, were simply ignored. If
what we need to do to defend ourselves from cyber war opens the possibility of further
government abuse, we will need to do more than simply pass laws making such government
action illegal. That has not stopped some in the past. (Cheney, Iâ m thinking of you here.) We will
Page 66
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
also have to create empowered, independent organizations to investigate whether abuses are
occurring and to bring legal action against those who are violating privacy laws and civil liberties.
The safest way to deal with the threat of further abuse is, of course, not to create new programs
that government officials could misuse to violate our rights. There may be times, however, as in
the case of cyber war, when we should examine whether effective safeguards can be put in place
so that we can start new programs that entail some risk.
4. CASSANDRAS AND RED HERRINGS
Part of the reason that we are so unprepared today is the â  boy who cried wolf too soonâ
phenomenon. Sometimes the boy who cries wolf can see the wolf coming from a lot farther away
than everyone else. The Joint Security Commission of 1994, the Marsh Commission of 1997, the
Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) commission of 2008, the National
Academy of Science commission of 2009, and many more in between have all spoken of a
major cyber security or cyber war risk. They have been criticized by many as Cassandras, the
type of people who are always predicting disaster. The earth will be hit by a giant meteor. A shift
in magnetic north from one pole to another will cause solar wind that will destroy the atmosphere.
Well, almost all real experts in the relevant fields of science believe the meteor and pole-shifting
scenarios will happen. They just do not know when, and therefore we probably should not get
too excited. The various commissions and groups warning about cyber war have not really been
wrong about the timing; they were warning us when we had sufficient time to do something in
advance of a disaster. It is worth remembering that, despite the bad rap she gets, Cassandra was
not wrong about her predictions; she was simply cursed by Apollo never to be believed.
Unfortunately, one thing that is too often believed is that there is a threat from â  cyber
terrorism.â Cyber terrorism is largely a red herring and, in general, the two words â  cyberâ and
â  terrorismâ should not be used in conjunction because they conjure up images of bin Laden
waging cyber war from his cave. He probably canâ t, at least not yet. (Moreover, heâ s probably
not in a cave, more likely a cushy villa.) Indeed, we do not have any good evidence that terrorists
have ever staged cyber war attacks on infrastructure.
To date, terrorists havenâ t so much attacked the Internet or used the Internet to attack
physical systems as they have used it to plan and coordinate attacks on embassies, railroads, and
hotels. They have also used the Internet to raise funds, recruit, and train. After al Qaeda lost their
training grounds in Afghanistan following 9/11, much of what went on there shifted to the web.
Training videos on how to build improvised explosive devices or how to stage beheadings were
just as effective delivered over a remote learning system as they were at a remote training camp.
The web kept terrorists from having to travel for training, which used to be a very good
opportunity for international law enforcement to catch a would-be terrorist. Remote training also
kept a bunch of terrorists from congregating in one place long enough for a cruise missile strike.
While Internet training has been a huge danger, spawning â  lone wolfâ attacks by terrorists who
never had any connection to al Qaeda central, what al Qaeda and other groups really excel at is
using the Internet for propaganda. Producing videos of beheadings and spreading radical
interpretations of the Koran across the Internet has allowed terrorist groups to reach a wide
audience and to do so with relative anonymity.
While al Qaeda has thus far not been capable of staging a cyber attack, that could very well
change. As with any developing technology, the cost and other barriers to entry are going down
each year. Staging a devastating cyber attack would not require a major industrial effort like
building a nuclear bomb. Understanding the control software for an electric grid, however, is not
a widely available skill. It is one thing to find a way to hack into a network, and quite another to
know what to do once youâ re inside. A well-funded terrorist group might find a highly skilled
hacker club that would do a cyber attack in return for a lot of money, but that has not happened
to date. One of the reasons for that may simply be that most hackers think that al Qaeda
members are crazy, dangerous, and un-trustworthy. When criminal hacker groups think of others
Page 67
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
that way, you know the real terrorists are pretty far out there.
5. MONEY TALKS
Another reason for inertia is that some people like things the way they are. Some of those people
have bought themselves access. I mentioned earlier that George W. Bushâ s first reaction when
told of a possible cyber security crisis was to ask what a certain computer industry CEO who
was one of his biggest campaign donors thought about it. You had probably already guessed that
the Bush Administration was not interested in playing hardball with the private sector. The first 
Homeland Security Strategy of the United States, put out in 2003, reads like a conservative
economic textbook on the power of the free market. You may be surprised, however, at how
Democratic administrations have also been captured by these arguments. You might think that the
new Democratic administration would be in favor of finally solving the market failure on cyber
security by introducing some new regulation, but you would be wrong. To understand why, letâ s
go to a party.
It was a lavish affair. All the big names in Washington were there. Over 250 guests joined to
celebrate the marriage of Melody Barnes to Marland Buckner. Barnes, President Obamaâ s
domestic policy advisor, had known her husband-to-be for years before they started dating; their
acquaintance goes back to her time on Capitol Hill, working for Ted Kennedy, and to his as
Chief of Staff to Harold Ford, Jr., of Tennessee. After a short ceremony at the Peopleâ s
Congregational United Church of Christ, the newlyweds and their guests retired to Washingtonâ s
Mellon Auditorium, which had been converted into a â  South Beachâ styleâ lounge, with hints of
silver and a floral theme for each table that was heavy on orchids. The locally sourced,
carbon-neutral menu featured short ribs, sea bass, and a selection of spring vegetables elegantly
arranged in bento boxes, followed by sliders and fries to keep the guestsâ  energy up until they
were released at some point after midnight.
What the New York Times Weddings and Celebrations reporter described as â  a bevy of
Obama Administration officialsâ in attendance included White House Chief of Staff Rahm
Emanuel and Valerie Jarrett, a White House senior advisor and Assistant to the President for
Intergovernmental Relations. My friend Mona Sutphen, Deputy Chief of Staff, danced the night
away, as did former Clinton Chief of Staff John Podesta. Also in attendance, but not noted by
the Times, were a bevy of Microsoft executives. Buckner, a former director of government
affairs at the worldâ s largest software company and now an independent registered lobbyist, had
also invited some friends. Since going out on his own in 2008, Buckner took in lobbying fees,
more than a third of which were from Microsoft. It is too bad Mother Jones doesnâ t do
weddings. Their reporter might have noted that on that night, the Obama Administration was,
quite literally, in bed with Microsoft.
Microsoft makes OpenSecret.orgâ s top 30 list of â  Heavy Hitters,â donating to political causes.
While most of the organizations on that list are trade associations, Microsoft is one of only seven
companies that make the cut. Of course, Microsoft was making up for lost time. Before the
companyâ s battle with the Justice Department over antitrust issues in the late 1990s, the West
Coastâ based company wanted nothing more than to be left alone and stayed out of politics.
Before 1998, Microsoft and its employees were little inclined to spend their stock options
supporting East Coast politicians. That all changed when Clinton Administration lawyers argued
that the marketing of Windows was intended to create a monopoly. Donations started pouring in
from newly established political action committees and Microsoft employees alike. And in the
years 1998 through 2002, the majority of that money went to Republicans. Then, in 2004,
maybe disgusted by the war or maybe misunderestimating the Bush campaign, Microsoft began
donating to Democrats at almost twice the rate than to Republicans. In 2008, Microsoft beat
those numbers, giving $2.3 million to Democrats and only $900,000 to Republicans.
Maybe Microsoftâ s PACs and employees have good intentions, like so many Americans who
donated money and time to the Obama campaign who wanted nothing more than to see Obama
Page 68
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
in office. Marland Buckner told a reporter for Media General News Service that he would
â  follow White House rules â to the letterâ  to avoid any conflict of interest due to Barnesâ s new
job, and promised not to use his relationship with his spouse to attract clients. But Microsoft the
corporation has an agenda that is very clear: donâ t regulate security in the software industry, donâ 
t let the Pentagon stop using our software no matter how many security flaws it has, and donâ t
say anything about software production overseas or deals with China.
Microsoft has vast resources, literally billions of dollars in cash, or liquid asset reserves.
Microsoft is an incredibly successful empire built on the premise of market dominance with
low-quality goods. For years, Microsoftâ s operating system and applications, like its ubiquitous
Internet browser, have been prepackaged on the computers we buy. Getting an alternative was a
time-consuming and problematic task, until Apple began to open stores and advertise in the last
decade.
To be fair, Microsoft did not originally intend its software to be running critical systems.
Therefore, its goal was to get the product out the door fast and at a low cost of production. It did
not originally see any point to investing in the kind of rigorous quality assurance and quality
control processes that NASA insisted on for the software used in human space-flight systems.
The problem is that people did start using Microsoft products in critical systems, from military
weapons platforms to core banking and finance networks. They were, after all, much cheaper
than custom-built applications.
Every once in a while there is a wave of government efficiency improvements that brings
federal government agencies up to date with the cost-saving approaches being used in industry.
One of them was called the COTS campaign. The idea was to use commercial off-the-shelf
(COTS) software to replace specialized software that in the past the government would have
ordered up. Throughout the Cold War, the Pentagon had led much of this countryâ s technological
innovation. I remember being told that there were cameras without film that had been developed
for the government. (I could not quite understand how that would workâ until I bought one at
Best Buy a decade later.) Only after military applications were developed did the technology
eventually leak out for commercial use.
COTS stood that process on its head. Before the 1990s, most of the Pentagonâ s software
applications were purpose-built in-house or by a small number of trusted defense contractors.
No two systems were alike, which was how the defense contractors wanted it. The systems they
built were extremely expensive. They also made it very difficult for defense systems to work
interoperably. The COTS movement reduced the costs and allowed the Pentagon to create
interoperable systems because they all used the same computer languages and the same
operating systems. More and more applications were developed. Sensor grids were netted
together. The 5.5-million-computer Global Information Grid, or GIG, was created. Netcentric
warfare provided a huge advantage for the U.S. military, but it also introduced a huge
vulnerability.
COTS brought to the Pentagon all the same bugs and vulnerabilities that exist on your own
computer. In 1997, the U.S. Navy found out just how dangerous it could be to rely on these
systems for combat operations. The USS Yorktown, a Ticonderoga-class cruiser, was retrofitted
as the test bed for the Navyâ s â  smart shipâ program. The Yorktown had been outfitted with a
network of twenty-seven Pentium-powered workstations all running Windows NT, all tied to a
Windows server. The system controlled every aspect of ship operations, from bridge operations
to fire control to engine speed. When the Windows system crashed, as Windows often does, the
cruiser became a floating i-brick, dead in the water.
In response to the Yorktown incident and a legion of other failures of Windows-based
systems, the Pentagon began to look at Unix and the related Linux systems for critical operations.
Linux is an open-source system. What that means is that the computer code for the operating
system can be viewed and edited by the user. With Windows (and most other commercial
software), the source code is considered to be proprietary and is heavily guarded. Open source
Page 69

had a number of advantages for the Pentagon. First, Pentagon programmers and defense
contractors could customize the software to make it operate the way they wanted. They could
slice and dice the code to eliminate parts of the operating system that they did not need and that
could introduce bugs into the system. Second, after reducing the size of the operating system,
they could then run what the software industry refers to as â  toolsâ on the remaining lines of code
to try and identify bugs, malicious code, and other vulnerabilities.
Microsoft went on the warpath against Linux to slow the adoption of it by government
agencies, complete with appearances before congressional committees, including by Bill Gates.
Nonetheless, because there were government agencies using Linux, I asked NSA to do an
assessment of it. In a move that startled the open-source community, NSA joined that community
by publicly offering fixes to the Linux operating system that would improve its security. Microsoft
gave me the very clear impression that if the U.S. government promoted Linux, Microsoft would
stop cooperating with the U.S. government. While that did not faze me, it may have had an effect
on others. Microsoftâ s software is still being bought by most federal agencies, even though Linux
is free.
The banking and finance industry also started to look at open-source alternatives after the
repeated failure of Microsoft systems had cost the finance industry hundreds of millions a year. In
2004, a banking industry group, the Financial Services Roundtable, sent a delegation of
computer security specialists from the banks to Redmond, Washington, to confront Microsoft.
They demanded access to the secret Microsoft code. They were denied. They demanded to see
the quality-assurance standards Microsoft used so that they could compare them with other
software companies. They were denied. Microsoftâ s position with the U.S. banks is in contrast to
the program the company had announced in 2003 whereby, pursuant to agreement, Microsoft
provide participating national and international bodies access to its Windows source code, a
move designed to address concerns about the security of its operating system. Russia, China,
NATO, and the United Kingdom were early participants.
The banks threatened to start using Linux. Microsoft told them the conversion to Linux would
be very expensive for them. Moreover, the next version of Windows was being developed under
the code name Longhorn. Longhorn would be much better. Longhorn became Vista. Vista went
to market later than expected, delayed by flaws discovered in Microsoftâ s expanded tests
program. When Vista was sold, many corporate users experienced problems. Word spread and
many companies decided not to buy the new system. Microsoft suggested that it would stop
providing support for some of its older systems, forcing customers to upgrade.
Microsoft insiders have admitted to me that the company really did not take security seriously,
even when they were being embarrassed by frequent highly publicized hacks. Why should they?
There was no real alternative to its software, and they were swimming in money from their
profits. When Linux appeared, and later when Apple started to compete directly, Microsoft did
take steps to improve its quality. What they did first, however, was to employ a lot of spokesmen
to go to conferences, to customers, and to government agencies lobbying against moves to force
improvements in security. Microsoft can buy a lot of spokesmen and lobbyists for a fraction of
the cost of creating more secure systems. They are one of several dominant companies in the
cyber industry for whom life is good right now and change may be bad.
6. NO, I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING IT
Change, however, is coming. Like the United States, more and more nations are establishing
offensive cyber war organizations. U.S. Cyber Command also has a defensive mission, to defend
the Department of Defense. Who defends the rest?
As it stands now, the Department of Homeland Security defends the non-DoD part of the
federal government. The rest of us are on our own. There is no federal agency that has the
mission to defend the banking system, the transportation networks, or the power grid from cyber
attack. Cyber Command and DHS think that by defending their government customers they may
Page 70
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
coincidentally help the private sector a little, maybe. The government thinks it is the responsibility
of individual corporations to defend themselves from cyber war. Government officials will tell you
that the private sector wants it that way, wants to keep the government out of their systems. After
all, they are right that no one in government would know how to run a big bankâ s networks, or a
railroadâ s, or a power gridâ s.
When you talk to CEOs and the other C-level types in big companies (chief operating officers,
chief security officers, chief information officers, chief information security officers), they all say
pretty much the same things: we will spend enough on computer security to protect against the
day-to-day threat of cyber crime. We cannot, they say, be expected to know how to, or spend
the money to, defend against a nation-state attack in a cyber war. Then they usually add words
to the effect of, â  Defending against other nationsâ  militaries is the governmentâ s job, itâ s what we
pay taxes for.â
At the beginning of the era of strategic nuclear war capability, the U.S. deployed thousands of
air defense fighter aircraft and ground-based missiles to defend the population and the industrial
base, not just to protect military facilities. Every major city was ringed with Nike missile bases to
shoot down Soviet bombers. At the beginning of the age of cyber war, the U.S. government is
telling the population and industry to defend themselves. As one friend of mine asked, â  Can you
imagine if in 1958 the Pentagon told U.S. Steel and General Motors to go buy their own Nike
missiles to protect themselves? Thatâ s in effect what the Obama Administration is saying to
industry today.â
On this fundamental issue of whose job it is to defend Americaâ s infrastructure in a cyber war,
the government and industry are talking past each other. As a result, no one is defending the
likely targets in a cyber war, at least not in the U.S. In other countries, some of whom might be
cyber war adversaries someday, the defense part of cyber war might be doing a little better than
it is here.
THE CYBER WAR GAP
We noted earlier that the U.S. may have the most sophisticated and complex cyber war
capability, followed soon thereafter by Russia. China and perhaps France are in a close second
tier, but over twenty nations have some capability, including Iran and North Korea. Whether or
not this ranking is accurate, it is widely believed by cyber warriors. So, one can almost imagine
the American geek fighters sitting around after work in some secure location drinking their Red
Bulls and chanting â  U-S-A, U-S-A,â as at the Olympics, or â  Weâ re Number One!â as at a high
school football game. (My high school was so nerdy we chanted â  Sumus Primi!â) But are we
really number one? That obviously depends upon what criteria you employ.
In cyber offensive capability, the United States probably would rank first if you could develop
an appropriate contest. But there is more to cyber war than cyber offensive. There is also cyber
dependence, the degree to which a nation relies upon cyber-controlled systems. In a two-way
cyber war, that matters. As I discovered when I asked for a cyber war plan to go after
Afghanistan in 2001, there are sometimes no targets for cyber warriors. In a two-way cyber war,
that gives Afghanistan an advantage of sorts. If they had any offensive cyber capability (they didn
â t), the cyber war balance would have shifted in an interesting way. There is also the issue of
whether a nation can defend itself from cyber war. Obviously, Afghanistan can protect itself just
by being there and having no networks, but theoretically a nation may have networks and, unlike
us, be able to protect them. Cyber defense capability is also, therefore, a criterion: Can a nation
shut off its cyber connectivity to the rest of the world, or spot cyber attacks coming from inside
its geographical boundaries and stop them?
While the United States very likely possesses the most sophisticated offensive cyber war
capabilities, that offensive prowess cannot make up for the weaknesses in our defensive position.
As former Admiral McConnell has noted, â  Because we are the most developed technologically
â we have the most bandwidth running through our society and are more dependent on that
Page 71
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
bandwidthâ we are the most vulnerable.â We have connected more of our economy to the
Internet than any other nation. Of the eighteen civilian infrastructure sectors identified as critical
by the Department of Homeland Security, all have grown reliant on the Internet to carry out their
basic functions, and all are vulnerable to cyber attacks by nation-state actors. Contrast this with
China. While China has been developing its offensive cyber capability, it has also focused on
defense. The PLAâ s cyber warriors are tasked with both offense and defense in cyberspace, and
unlike in the case of the U.S. military, when they say defense, they mean defense of the nation,
not just defense of the militaryâ s networks. While I do not advocate an expanded role for the
Pentagon in protecting civilian systems in the U.S., there is no other agency or arm of the federal
government that has taken on that responsibility. In light of the eschewing of regulation that began
in the Clinton Administration and has continued through the Bush Administration and into the
Obama Administration, the private sector has not been required to improve security, nor has the
government stepped in to actively take on the role. In China, the networks that make up the
Chinese Internet infrastructure are all controlled by the government through direct ownership or
very close partnership with the private sector. There are no debates about the cost of security
when Chinese authorities demand new security measures. The networks are largely segmented
between government, academic, and commercial use. The Chinese government has both the
power and the means to disconnect Chinaâ s slice of the Internet from the rest of the world, which
it may very well do in the event of a conflict with the United States. The U.S. government has no
such authority or capability. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission has the legal
power to regulate but it largely chosen not to do that. In China, the government can set and
enforce standards, but it also goes many steps further.
The â  Internetâ in China is more like the internal network of a company, an intranet. The
government is the service provider and therefore in charge of the networkâ s defense. In China,
the government is actively defending the network. Not so in the United States. In the U.S., the
governmentâ s role is at least one step removed. As mentioned briefly in chapter 2, Chinaâ s
much-discussed Internet censorship, including â  the Great Firewall of China,â can also provide
security advantages. The technology that the Chinese use to screen e-mails for speech deemed
illegal can also provide the infrastructure to stop malware. China has also invested in developing
its own proprietary operating system that would not be susceptible to existing network attacks,
though technical problems have delayed its implementation. China launched and then temporarily
halted an effort to install software on all computers in China, software allegedly meant to keep
children from gaining access to pornography. The real intent, most experts believe, was to give
China control over every desktop in the country. (When word of the plan got out in the hacker
community, they quickly found vulnerabilities that could have given almost anyone control over
the system, and the Chinese promptly delayed the program.) These efforts show how seriously
the Chinese take their defense, as well as the direction their efforts are headed. China,
meanwhile, remains behind the United States in the automation of its critical systems. Its electric
power system, for example, relies on control systems that require a large degree of manual
control. This is an advantage in cyber war.
MEASURING CYBER WAR STRENGTH
It would be great if the only thing we had to take into account in measuring our cyber war
strength was one factor, our ability to attack other nations. If that were the only consideration, the
United States might do really well when compared to other nations. Unfortunately for us, a
realistic measurement of cyber war strength also needs to include an assessment of two other
factors: defense and dependence. â  Defenseâ is a measure of a nationâ s ability to take actions that
under attack, actions which will block or mitigate the attack. â  Dependenceâ is the extent to which
a nation is wired, reliant upon networks and systems that could be vulnerable in the event of
cyber war attack.
To illustrate how these three factors (offense, defense, and dependence) interact, I have
Page 72
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
created a chart. The chart assigns scores to several countries for each of the three factors.
Quibblers will argue with the overly simplistic methodology: I gave each of the three measures
equal weight and then added the three scores together to get an overall score for a nation. The
scores assigned to each nation are based on my assessment of their offense power, their
defensive capability, and the extent to which they are dependent on cyber systems. There is one
counterintuitive aspect to the chart: the less wired a nation is, the higher its score on the
dependence ranking. Being a wired nation is generally a good thing, but not when you are
measuring its ability to withstand cyber war.
OVERALL CYBER WAR STRENGTH
Nation: U.S.
Cyber Offense: 8
Cyber Dependence: 2
Cyber Defense: 1
Total: 11
Nation: Russia
Cyber Offense: 7
Cyber Dependence: 5
Cyber Defense: 4
Total: 16
Nation: China
Cyber Offense: 5
Cyber Dependence: 4
Cyber Defense: 6
Total: 15
Nation: Iran
Cyber Offense: 4
Cyber Dependence: 5
Cyber Defense: 3
Total: 12
Nation: North Korea
Cyber Offense: 2
Cyber Dependence: 9
Cyber Defense: 7
Total: 18
The results are revelatory. China has a high â  defenseâ score, in part because it has plans and
capability to disconnect the entire nationâ s networks from the rest of cyberspace. The U.S., by
contrast, has neither the plans nor the capability to do that because the cyber connections into the
U.S. are privately owned and operated. China can limit cyberspace utilization in a crisis by
disconnecting nonessential users. The U.S. cannot. North Korea gets a high score for both
â  defenseâ and â  lack of dependence.â North Korea can sever its limited connection to
cyberspace even more easily and effectively than China can. Moreover, North Korea has so few
systems dependent upon cyberspace that a major cyber war attack on North Korea would
cause almost no damage. Remember that cyber dependence is not about the percentage of
homes with broadband or the per capita number of smart phones; itâ s about the extent to which
critical infrastructures (electric power, rails, pipelines, supply chains) are dependent upon
Page 73
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
networked systems and have no real backup.
When you think about â  defenseâ capability and â  lack of dependenceâ together, many nations
score far better than the U.S. Their ability to survive a cyber war, with lower costs, compared to
what would happen to the U.S., creates a â  cyber war gap.â They can use cyber war against us
and do great damage, while at the same time they may be able to withstand a U.S. cyber war
response. The existence of that â  cyber war gapâ may tempt some nation to attack the United
States. Closing that gap should be the highest priority of U.S. cyber warriors. Improving our
offensive capability does not close the gap. It is impossible to reduce our dependence on
networked systems at this point. Hence, the only way we can close the gap, the only way we can
improve our overall Cyber War Strength score, is to improve our defenses. Letâ s take a look at
how we might do that.

CHAPTER FIVE
TOWARD A DEFENSIVE STRATEGY
Military theorists and statesmen, from Sun Tzu to von Clausewitz to Herman Kahn, have for centuries
defined and redefined military strategy in varying ways, but they tend to agree that it involves an
articulation of goals, means (broadly defined), limits (perhaps), and possibly sequencing. In short, military
strategy is an integrated theory about what we want do and how, in general, we plan to do it. In part
because Congress has required it, successive U.S. administrations have periodically published a National
Security Strategy and a National Military Strategy for all the world to read. Within the military, the U.S.
has many substrategies, such as a naval strategy, a counterinsurgency strategy, and a strategic nuclear
strategy. The U.S. government has also publicly published strategies for dealing with issues wherein the
military plays only a limited role, such as controlling illegal narcotics trafficking, countering terrorism, and
stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Oh yes, there is also that National Strategy to
Secure Cyberspace dating back to 2003; but there is no publicly available cyber war strategy.
In the absence of a strategy for cyber war, we do not have an integrated theory about how to address
key issues. To prove that, letâ s play Twenty Questions and see if there are agreed-upon answers to some
pretty obvious questions about how to conduct cyber war:
ï· What do we do if we wake up one day and find the western half of the U.S.
without electrical power as the result of a cyber attack?
ï· Is the advent of cyber war a good thing, or does it place us at a disadvantage?
ï· Do we envision the use of cyber war weapons only in response to the use of
cyber war weapons against us?
ï· Are cyber weapons something that we will employ routinely in both small and
large conflicts? Will we use them early in a conflict because they give us a
unique advantage in seeking our goals, such as maybe effecting a rapid end to
the conflict?
ï· Do we think we want to have plans and capabilities to conduct â  stand-aloneâ
cyber war against another nation? And will we fight in cyberspace even when
weâ re not shooting at the other side in physical space?
ï· Do we see cyberspace as another domain (like the sea, airspace, or outer
space) in which we must be militarily dominant and in which we will engage an
opponent while simultaneously conducting operations in other domains?
ï· How surely do we have to identify who attacked us in cyberspace before we
respond? What standards will we use for these identifications?
ï· Will we ever hide the fact that it was us who attacked with cyber weapons?
ï· Should we be hacking into other nationsâ  networks in peacetime? If so, should
there be any constraints on what we would do in peacetime?
ï· What do we do if we find that other nations have hacked into our networks in
peacetime? What if they left behind logic bombs in our infrastructure networks?
ï· Do we intend to use cyber weapons primarily or initially against military targets
only? How do we define military targets?
ï· Or do we see the utility of cyber weapons being their ability to inflict disruption
on the economic infrastructure or the society at large?
ï· What is the importance of avoiding collateral damage with our cyber weapons?
How might avoiding it limit our use of the weapons?
ï· If we are attacked with cyber weapons, under what circumstances would, or
should, we respond with kinetic weapons? How much of the answer to this
question should be publicly known in advance?
ï· What kind of goals specific to the employment of cyber weapons would we
want to achieve if we conducted cyber war, either in conjunction with kinetic
Page 75
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
war or as a stand-alone activity?
ï· Should the line between peace and cyber war be brightly delineated, or is there
an advantage to us in blurring that distinction?
ï· Would we fight cyber war in a coalition with other nations, helping to defend
their cyberspace and sharing our cyber weapons, tactics, and targets?
ï· What level of command authority should authorize the use of cyber weapons,
select the weapons, and approve the targets?
ï· Are there types of targets that we believe should not be attacked using cyber
weapons? Do we attack them anyway if similar U.S. facilities are hit first by
cyber or other weapons?
ï· How do we signal our intentions with regard to cyber weapons in peacetime
and in crisis? Are there ways that we can use our possession of cyber weapons
to deter an opponent?
ï· If an opponent is successful in launching a widespread, disabling attack on our
military or on our economic infrastructure, how does that affect our other
military and political strategies?
Didnâ t do too well finding the answers anywhere in U.S. government documents,
congressional hearings, or officialsâ  speeches? I didnâ t, either. To be fair, these are not easy
questions to answer, which is, no doubt, part of the reason they have not yet been knitted
together into a strategy. As with much else, how one answers these and other questions will
depend upon oneâ s experience and responsibilities, as well as the perspective that both create.
Any general would like to be able to flip a switch and turn off the opposing force, especially if the
same cannot be done to his forces in return. Modern generals know, however, that militaries are
one of many instruments of the state, and the ultimate success of a military is now judged not just
by what it does to the opponent, but by how well it protects and supports the rest of the state,
including its underpinning economy. Military leaders and diplomats have also learned from past
experiences that there is a fine line between prudent preparation to defend oneself and
provocative activities that may actually increase the probability of conflict. Thus, crafting a cyber
war strategy is not as obvious as simply embracing our newly discovered weapons, as the U.S.
military did with nuclear weapons following Hiroshima.
It took a decade and a half after nuclear weapons were first used before a complex strategy
for employing them, and, better yet, for not using them, was articulated and implemented. During
those first years of the nuclear weapons era, accidental war almost occurred several times. The
nuclear weapons strategy that eventually emerged reduced that risk significantly. Nuclear war
strategy will be referenced a lot in this and the next chapter. The big differences between cyber
war and nuclear war are obvious, but some of the concepts developed in the creation of nuclear
war strategy have applicability to this new field. Others do not. Nonetheless, we can learn
something about how a complex strategy for using new weapons can be developed by reviewing
what went on in the 1950s and 1960s. And, where appropriate, we can borrow and adapt some
of those concepts as we try to piece together a cyber war strategy.
THE ROLE OF DEFENSE IN OUR CYBER WAR STRATEGY
I asked at the beginning of this book: Are we better off in a world with cyber weapons and cyber
war than in a theoretical world in which they never existed? The discussion in the ensuing
chapters demonstrated, at least to me, that as things stand today the United States has gaping
new vulnerabilities because others have cyber war capabilities. Indeed, because of its greater
dependence on cyber-controlled systems and its inability thus far to create national cyber
defenses, the United States is currently far more vulnerable to cyber war than Russia or China.
The U.S. is more at risk from cyber war than are minor states like North Korea. We may even
be at risk some day from nations or nonstate actors lacking cyber war capabilities, but who can
hire teams of highly capable hackers.
Page 76
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Put aside for the moment the question of how it would start and consider a U.S.-Chinese
cyber war as an example. We might have better offensive cyber weapons than others, but the
fact that we might be able to turn off the Chinese air defense system will give most Americans
limited comfort if in some future crisis the cyber warriors of the Peopleâ s Liberation Army have
kept power off in most American cities for weeks, shut the financial markets by corrupting their
data, and created food and parts shortages nationwide by scrambling the routing systems at
major U.S. railroads. Although much of China is highly advanced, a lot of it is still far from
dependent upon networks controlled in cyberspace. The Chinese government may also have to
worry less about temporary inconveniences experienced by its citizens or the political
acceptability of measures it might impose in an emergency.
Net/net, cyber war puts America at a disadvantage right now. Whatever we can do to â  them,â
chances are they can do more to us. We need to change that situation.
Unless we reduce our vulnerabilities to cyber attack, we will suffer from self-deterrence. Our
knowing about what others could do to us may create a situation in which we are reluctant to use
our superiority in other areas, like conventional weapons, in situations where it might be
warranted for us to get involved. Other nationsâ  cyber weapons may deter us from acting, not
just in cyberspace but in other ways as well. In future scenarios, like ones involving China and
Taiwan, or China and the offshore oil dispute, will an American President really still have the
option of sending carrier battle groups to prevent Chinese action? What President would order
the Navy into the Taiwan Straits, as Clinton did in 1996, if he or she thought that a power
blackout that had just hit Chicago was a signal and that blackouts could spread to every major
American city if we got involved? Or maybe the data difficulties the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange might have just experienced could happen to every major financial institution? Worse
yet, what if the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs tells the President that he does not really know
whether the Chinese can launch a damaging cyber attack that would leave the carrier battle group
sitting helpless in the water? Would the President run the risk of deploying our naval superiority if
trying to do so might only demonstrate that an opponent can shut down, blind, or confuse our
forces?
The fact that our vital systems are so vulnerable to cyber war also increases crisis instability.
As long as our economic and military systems are so obviously vulnerable to cyber war, they will
tempt opponents to attack in a period of tensions. Opponents may think that they have an
opportunity to reshape the political, economic, and military balance by demonstrating to the
world what they can do to America. They may believe that the threat of even greater damage will
appear credible and will prevent a U.S. response. Once they do launch a cyber attack, however,
the U.S. leadership may feel compelled to respond. That response might not be limited to
cyberspace, and the conflict could quickly escalate and get out of control.
These current circumstances argue for rapidly taking steps to reduce the strategic imbalance in
which the U.S. is disadvantaged by the advent of cyber war capabilities. The answer is not to just
add to our cyber offensive superiority. More U.S. cyber attack capability is unlikely to improve
the imbalance or end the potential crisis instability. Unlike in conventional war, a superior offense
cannot be certain to find and destroy all of the opponentâ s offensive capability. The tools needed
to cripple the U.S. may already be in the U.S. They may not even have entered America through
cyberspace, where they might be discovered, but rather on CDs in diplomatic pouches, or in
USB thumb drives in businessmenâ s briefcases.
What is needed to reduce the risk that a nation-state will threaten to use cyber weapons
against us in a crisis is for the U.S. to have a credible defense. We must cast so much doubt in
the mind of the potential attacker that an attack will work against our defenses that they are he
would be deterred from trying it. We want potential opponents to think that their cyber arrows
might just bounce off our shields. Or at least they should think that enough of our key systems are
sufficiently protected that the damage they can do to us will not be decisive. We are a long way
from there today.
Page 77
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Defending the U.S. from cyber attacks should be the first goal of a cyber war strategy. After
all, the primary purpose of any U.S. national security strategy is the defense of the United States.
We do not develop weapons for the purpose of extending our hegemony over various domains
(the seas, outer space, cyberspace), but as a way to safeguard the nation. While that seems
simple enough, it gets complicated quickly because there are those who believe that the best way
in which to defend is to attack and destroy the opponent before they can inflict damage on us.
When General Robert Elder was commander of the Air Force Cyberspace Command he told
reporters that although his command has a defensive responsibility, it planned to disable an
opponentâ s computer networks. â  We want to go in and knock them out in the first round,â he
said. This is reminiscent of another Air Force general, Curtis LeMay, who in the 1950s, as
commander of Strategic Air Command, explained to RAND Corporation analysts that his
bombers would not be destroyed on the ground by a Soviet attack because â  weâ re going first.â
That kind of thinking is dangerous. If we do not have a credible defense strategy, we will be
forced to escalate in a cyber conflict very quickly. We will need to be more aggressive in getting
our adversaryâ s systems so that we can stop their attacks before they reach our undefended
systems. That will be destabilizing, forcing us to treat potential adversaries as current ones. We
will also need to take a stronger declaratory posture to try to deter attacks on our systems by
threatening to â  go kineticâ in response to a cyber attack, and it will be more likely that our
adversaries will think they can call that bluff.
One reason that many U.S. cyber warriors think that the best defense is a good offense is their
perception of how difficult it would be to defend only by protecting. The military sees how
extensive the important targets are in Americaâ s cyberspace and throws up its hands at the task
of defending them all. Besides, they note (conveniently) that the U.S. military does not have the
legal authority to defend privately owned and operated targets in the United States such as
banks, power companies, railroads, and airlines.
This argument is the same one the Bush Administration made about Homeland Security after
9/11: that it would be too expensive to defend the U.S. against terrorists at home, so we needed
to go to â  the source.â That thinking has had us knee deep in two wars for the last decade at a
cost projected to reach $2.4 trillion, and has already cost over 5,000 American lives.
Itâ s axiomatic that there is no single measure (or, as many in the Pentagon like to say, in a nod
to the cowboy known as the Lone Ranger, no â  silver bulletâ) that could secure U.S. cyberspace.
There may, however, be a handful of steps that would protect enough of the key assets, or at
least throw doubt into the mind of a potential attacker, by making it very difficult to stage a
successful large-scale cyber assault on America.
Protecting every computer in the U.S. from cyber attack is hopeless, but it may be possible to
sufficiently harden the important networks that a nation-state attacker would target. We need to
harden them enough that no attack could disable our militaryâ s ability to respond or severely
undermine our economy. Even if our defense is not perfect, these hardened networks may be
able to survive sufficiently, or bounce back quickly enough, so that the damage done by an attack
would not be crippling. If we canâ t defend every major system, what do we protect? There are
three key components to U.S. cyberspace that must be defended, or, to borrow another phrase
from nuclear strategy, a â  triad.â
THE DEFENSIVE TRIAD
Our Defensive Triad strategy would be a departure from what Clinton, Bush, and now Obama
have done. Clinton in his National Plan and Bush in his National Strategy both sought to have
every critical infrastructure defend itself from cyber attack. There were eventually eighteen
industries identified as critical infrastructures, ranging from electric power and banking to food
and retail. As previously noted, all three Presidents â  eschewed regulationâ as a means of reducing
cyber vulnerabilities. Little happened. Bush, in the last of his eight years in office, approved an
approach to cyber war that largely ignored the privately owned and operated infrastructures. It
Page 78

focused on defending government systems and on creating a military Cyber Command. Obama is
implementing the Bush plan, including the military command, with little or no modification to date.
The Defensive Triad Strategy would use federal regulation as a major tool to create cyber
security requirements, and it would, at least initially, focus defensive efforts on only three sectors.
First is the backbone. As noted in chapter 3, there are hundreds of Internet service provider
companies, but only a half dozen or so large ISPs provide what is called the backbone of the
Internet. They include AT&T, Verizon, Level 3, Qwest, and Sprint. These are the â  trunks,â or
Tier 1 ISPs, meaning that they can connect directly to most other ISPs in the country. These are
the companies that own the â  big pipes,â thousands of miles of fiber-optic cable running across the
country, into every corner of the nation, and hooking up with undersea fiber-optic cables to
connect to the world. Over 90 percent of Internet traffic in the U.S. moves on these Tier 1â s, and
it is usually impossible to get to anyplace in the U.S. without traversing one of these backbone
providers. So, if you protect the Tier 1â s, you are worrying about most of the Internet
infrastructure in the U.S. and also other parts of cyberspace.
To attack most private-sector and government networks, you generally have to connect to
them over the Internet and specifically, at some point, over the backbone. If you could catch the
attack entering the backbone, you could stop it before it got to the network it was going to
attack. If you did that, you would not have to worry as much about hardening tens of thousands
of potential targets for cyber attack. Think about it this way: if you knew someone from New
Jersey was going to drive a truck bomb into a building in Manhattan, you could defend every
important building on the island (have fun getting agreement on which ones those would be), or
you could inspect all trucks before they went on one of the fourteen bridges or into the four
tunnels that connect to the island.
Inspecting all the Internet traffic about to enter the backbone theoretically poses two significant
problems, one technical and one of policy. The technical problem is, simply, this: there is a lot of
traffic and no one wants you slowing it down to look for malware or attack scripts. The policy
problem is that no one wants you reading their e-mails or webpage requests.
The technical issue can be overcome with existing technology. As speeds increase, there could
be difficulty scanning without introducing delay if the scanning technology failed to keep pace.
Today, however, several companies have demonstrated hardware/software combinations that
can scan what moves on the Internet, the small packets of ones and zeros that combine to make
an e-mail or webpage. The scanning can be done so fast that it introduces no measurable delay in
the packetsâ  speeding down the fiber-optic line. And it is not just the â  toâ and â  fromâ lines on the
packets, the so-called headers, that would be examined, but the data level, where the malware
would be. This capability is described as â  deep-packet inspection,â and the speed is called â  line
rate.â The absence of delay is called â  no latency.â We can now do deep-packet inspection at a
line rate with no latency. So the technical hurdle has been met, at least for now.
The policy problem can also be solved. We do not want the government or even an ISP
reading our e-mails. The system of deep-packet inspection proposed here would be fully
automated. It would not be looking for keywords, but only at the payload to see if there are
predetermined patterns of ones and zeros that match up with known attack software. Itâ s looking
for signatures. If it finds an attack, it could just â  black holeâ the packets, dump them into cyber
oblivion, or it could quarantine them, put them aside for analysis. For Americans to be satisfied
that such a deep-packet inspection system were not Big Brother spying on us, it would have to
be run by the Tier 1 ISPs themselves and not by the government. Moreover, there would have to
be rigorous oversight by an active Privacy and Civil Liberties Protection Board to ensure that
neither the ISPs nor the government was illegally spying on us.
The idea of putting deep-packet inspection systems on the backbone does not create the risk
of government spying on us. That risk already exists. As we saw with the illegal wiretapping in the
Bush Administration, if the checks and balances in the system fail, the government can already
improperly monitor citizens. That is a major concern and needs to be prevented by real oversight
Page 79

mechanisms and tough punishment for those who break the law. Our nationâ s strong belief in
privacy rights and civil liberties is not incompatible with what we need to do to defend our
cyberspace. Giving guns to police does raise the possibility that some policemen may get
involved in unjust shootings on rare occasions, but we recognize that we need armed police to
defend us and we work hard at making sure that unjust shootings are prevented. So, too, we can
deploy deep-packet inspection systems on Internet backbone ISPs, recognizing that we need
them there to protect us, and we have to make sure that they do not get misused.
How would such a system get deployed? The deep-packet inspection systems would be
placed where fiber-optic cables come up out of the ocean and enter the U.S., at â  peering
points,â where the Tier 1 ISPs connect to each other and the smaller networks, and at various
other points on the Tier 1 networks. The government, perhaps Homeland Security, would
probably have to pay for the systems, even though they would be run by the ISPs and maybe
systems integrator companies. The signatures of the malware that the black box scanners would
look for would come from Internet security companies such as Symantec and McAfee, which
have elaborate global systems to look for malware. The ISPs and government agencies could
also provide signatures.
The black box inspectors would have to be connected to each other on a closed network,
what is called â  out-of-band communicationsâ (not on the Internet), so that they could be updated
quickly and reliably even if the Internet were experiencing difficulties. Imagine that a new piece of
attack software enters into cyberspace, one that no one has ever seen before. This â  Zero Dayâ
malware begins to cause a problem by attacking some sites. The deep-packet inspection system
would be tied into Internet security companies, research centers, and government agencies that
are looking for Zero Day attacks. Within minutes of the malware being seen, its signature would
be flashed out to the scanners, which would start blocking it and would contain the attack.
A precursor to this kind of deep-packet inspection system is already being deployed. Verizon
and AT&T can, at some locations, scan for signatures that they have identified, but they have
been reluctant to â  black holeâ (or kill) malicious traffic because of the risk that they might be sued
by customers whose service is interrupted. The carriers would probably win any such suit
because their service-level agreements (SLAs) with their customers usually state that they have
the right to deny service if the customerâ s activity is illegal or disruptive to the network.
Nonetheless, because of the typical abundance of caution from their lawyers, the companies are
doing less than they could to secure cyberspace. Legislation or regulation is probably needed to
clarify the issue.
The Department of Homeland Securityâ s â  Einsteinâ system, discussed in chapter 4, has been
installed at some of the locations where government departments connect to the Tier 1 ISPs.
Einstein only monitors government networks. The Defense Department has a similar system at the
sixteen locations where the unclassified DoD intranet connects to the public Internet.
A more advanced system, with higher speed capacity, more memory and processing
capabilities, and out-of-band connectivity, could help to minimize or deter a large-scale cyber
attack if it were broadly deployed to protect not just the government, but the backbone on which
all networks rely. By defending the backbone in this way, we should be able to stop most attacks
against our key government and private-sector systems. The independent Federal
Communications Commission has the authority today to issue regulations requiring the Tier 1
ISPs to establish such a protective system. The Tier 1â s could pass along the costs to their
customers and to smaller ISPs that peer with them. Alternatively, Congress could appropriate
funds for some or all of the system. So far, the government is only beginning to move in this
direction, and then only to protect itself, not the private-sector networks on which our economy,
government, and national security rely.
ISPs should also be required to do more to keep our nationâ s portion of the cyber ecosystem
clean. Ed Amoroso, the chief security officer at AT&T, told me that his security operations
center watches as computers that have been taken over by a botnet spew out DDOS and spam.
Page 80
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
They know what subscribers are infected, but they donâ t dare inform the customer (much less cut
off access) out of fear that customers would switch providers and try to sue them for violating
their privacy. That equation needs to be stood on its head. ISPs should be required to inform
customers of the network when data shows that their computers have been made part of a
botnet. ISPs should be required to shut off access if customers do not respond after being
notified. They should also be required to provide free antivirus software to their subscribers, as
many now do because it helps them manage their bandwidth better; and subscribers should be
required to use it (or whatever antivirus software they choose). We donâ t let car manufacturers
sell cars without seat belts, and in most states we donâ t let people drive cars unless they are
wearing them. The same logic should apply on the Internet, because poor computer security by
an individual creates a national security problem for us all.
In addition to the Tier 1 carriers screening Internet traffic at packet level for known malware,
blocking those packets that match previously identified attacks, related steps could be added to
strengthen the system. First, with relatively little investment of money and time, software could be
developed to identify â  morphed malware.â The software would look for slight variations in
known attack signatures, changes that attackers might use in attempts to slip by the deep packet
inspection of previously identified hacks. Second, in addition to having the Tier 1 ISPs looking
for malware, government and large, regulated commercial institutions such as banks would also
contract with hosting and data centers to do deep-packet inspection. At a handful of large
hosting data centers scattered around the country, the fibers of Tier 1 ISPs come together to do
switching among the networks. At these locations, some large institutions also have their own
servers locked behind fencing in row upon row of blinking equipment or stashed in highly secured
rooms. The operators of these centers can screen for known malware as a second level of
defense. Moreover, the data center operators or IT security firms can also look at data after it
has passed by. The data centers can provide managed security services, looking for anomalous
activity that might be caused by previously unidentified malware. Unlike the attempts to block
known malware as it comes in, the managed security services would look for patterns of
suspicious behavior and anomalous activity of data packets over time. By doing that, they may be
able to spot more complicated two-step attacks and new Zero Day malware. That new malware
would then be added to the list of things to be blocked. Searches could be performed for
locations in the data banks where the new malware had gone, perhaps allowing the system to
stop large-scale exfiltration of data.
By paying the ISPs and managed security service providers to do this sort of data screening,
the government would remain sufficiently removed from the process to protect privacy and to
encourage competition. The governmentâ s role, in addition to paying for the defenses, would be
to provide its own information about malware (locked up in a black box if necessary), incentivize
firms to discover attacks, and create a mechanism to allow the public to confirm that privacy
information and civil liberties are well protected. Unlike a single line of defense owned and
operated by the government (such as the â  Einsteinâ system being created by the Department of
Homeland Security to protect civilian federal agencies), this would be a multilayer,
multiple-provider system that would encourage innovation and competition among private sector
IT companies. If the government was aware that a cyber war was about to break out, or if one
already had, a series of federal network operation centers could interact with these private IT
defenders and with the network operation centers (NOCs) of key privately owned institutions to
coordinate a defense. For that to happen, the government would have to create in advance a
dedicated communications network among the NOCs, one that was highly secure, entirely
separated, and in other ways different from the Internet. (The fact that such a new network
would be needed should tell you something about the Internet.)
The second prong of a Defensive Triad is a secure power grid. The simplest way to think
about this idea is to ask, as some have, why the hell is the power grid connected to cyberspace
at all, anyway? Without electricity, most other things we rely on do not work, or at least not for
Page 81
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
long. The easiest thing a nation-state cyber attacker could do today to have a major impact on
the U.S. would be to shut down sections of the Eastern or Western Interconnects, the two big
grids that cover the U.S. and Canada. (Texas has its own, third, grid). Backup power systems
are limited in duration and notorious for not coming on when needed (as happened at my house
last night when a lightning storm hit the rural power net, creating a localized blackout. My
automatic starting generator sat there like an oversized door stop). Could those three North
American power-sharing systems, composed of hundreds of generation and transmission
companies, be secured?
Yes, but not without additional federal regulation. That regulation would be focused on
disconnecting the control network for the power generation and distribution companies from the
Internet and then making access to those networks require authentication. It would really not be
all that expensive, but try telling that to the power companies. When asked what assets of theirs
were critical and should be covered by cyber security regulations, the industry replied that 95
percent of their assets should be left unregulated with regard to cyber security. One cyber
security expert who works with the major cyber security auditing firms said he asked each audit
firm that had worked with power companies if they had been able in their audits to get to the
power grid controls from the Internet. All six firms said they had. How long did it take them?
None had taken longer than an hour. That hour was spent hacking into the companyâ s public
website, then from there into the companyâ s intranet, then through â  the bridgeâ they all have to
their control systems. Some audits cut the time by hacking into the Internet-based phones (voice
over Internet protocol, or VOIP, phones) that were sitting in the control rooms. These phones
are by definition connected to the Internet; thatâ s how they connect to the telephone network. If
they are in the control room, they are also probably connected to the network that runs the
power system. Good thinking, huh? Oh, it gets better. In some places the commands to electrical
grid components are sent in the clear (that is, unencrypted) via radio, including microwave. Just
sit nearby, transmit on the same frequency with more energy in your signal than the power
company is using, and you are giving the commands (if you know what the command software
looks like).
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) promises that in 2010 it really will start
penalizing power companies that do not have secure cyber systems. What they have not said is
how the Commission will know who is in violation, since the FERC doesnâ t have the staff to
regularly inspect. The U.S. Department of Energy, however, has hired two cyber security experts
to determine if the $3.4 billion in Smart Grid grants are going to new programs that are
adequately secured. Smart Grid is the Obama Administrationâ s idea to make the power grid even
more integrated and digitized. Power companies can ask for some of that money by submitting
proposals to the Energy Department. When they do, the two experts will read the proposals to
see if there is a section somewhere that says â  cyber security.â The Energy Department refuses to
say who the two experts are or what they will be looking for in the â  cyber securityâ section of the
grant proposal. There are no publicly available standards. One idea for a standard might be that
the taxpayers donâ t give any of the $3.4 billion in Smart Grid money to companies that havenâ t
secured their current systems. Donâ t expect the Energy Department to use that standard anytime
soon, because that would mean taking advantage of this unique federal giveaway program to
incentivize people to make things more secure. That smacks of regulation, which, of course, is
just like socialism, which is un-American. So, we will soon have a more digital Smart Grid, which
will also be a Less Secure Grid. How could we make the U.S. national electrical system a Smart 
and Secure Grid?
The first step in that direction would be issuing and enforcing serious regulations to require
electric companies to make it next to impossible to obtain unauthorized access to the control
network for the power grid. That would mean no pathway at all from the Internet to the control
system. In addition, the same kind of deep-packet inspection boxes I proposed placing on the
Internet backbone could be placed on the points where the control systems link to the power
Page 82
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
companiesâ  intranets. Then, just to make things even harder for an attacking cyber warrior, we
could require that the actual control signals sent to generators, transformers, and other key
components be both encrypted and authenticated. Encrypting the signals would mean that even if
you could hack your way in and try to give an instruction to a generator, you would not have the
secret code to do so. Authenticating the commands would mean that through a proof of identity
procedure, or electronic â  handshake,â the generator or transformer would know for sure that the
command signal it was getting was coming from the right place. Because some parts of the grid
might still be taken over by a nation-state hacker, certain key sections should have a backup
communication system for sending command and control signals so that they could restore
service.
Many people dismiss the significance of an attack on the power grid. As one senior U.S.
government official said to me, â  Power blackouts take place all the time. After a few hours, the
lights come back.â Maybe not. The power comes back after a few hours when what has caused
it to fail is a lightning storm. If the failure is the result of intentional activity, it will likely be a much
longer blackout. In what is known as the â  Repeated Smackdown Scenario,â cyber attacks take
down the power grid, and keep it down for months.
If the attacks destroy generators, as in the Aurora tests, replacing them can take up to six
months, because each must be custom built. Having an attack take place in many locations
simultaneously, and then happen again when the grid comes back up, could cripple the economy
by halting the distribution of food and other consumer goods, shutting down factories, and forcing
the closure of financial markets.
Do we really need improved regulation? Should we force power companies to spend more to
secure their networks? Is the need real? Letâ s ask the head of U.S. Cyber Command, General
Keith Alexander, the man whose cyber warriors would attack other nationsâ  electric grids.
Knowing what he knows he can do to others, does the General think we need to do more to
protect our own power grid? Thatâ s essentially what he was asked in a congressional hearing in
2009. He replied, â  So the power companies are going to have to go out and change the
configuration of their networksâ ¦. [T]o upgrade their networks to make sure they are secure is a
jump in cost for themâ ¦. And now youâ re going to have to work through their regulatory
committees to get the rate increases so that they can actually secure their networksâ ¦. [H]ow
does government, because weâ re interested in perhaps having reliable power, how do we ensure
that that happens as a critical infrastructure?â It was a little rambling, but General Alexander
seemed to be saying that power companies need to reconfigure so we can have secure, reliable
electricity, that this may mean they have to spend more, and that the regulatory organizations will
have to help make that happen. Heâ s right.
The third prong of the Defensive Triad is Defense itself, as in the Department of Defense.
There is little chance that a nation-state would stage a major cyber attack against the U.S.
without trying to cripple DoD in the process. Why? While a nation-state actor might try to cripple
our country and our will by destroying private-sector systems like the power grid, pipelines,
transportation, or banking, it is hard to imagine such actions coming as a bolt from the blue.
Cyber attacks would only likely come in a period of heightened tensions between the U.S. and
the attacker nation. In such an atmosphere, the attacker would probably already fear the
possibility of conventional, or kinetic, action by the U.S. military. Moreover, if an opponent were
going to hit us with a large cyber attack, they would have to assume that we might respond
kinetically. A cyber attack on the U.S. military would likely concentrate on DoDâ s networks.
For simplicity, letâ s say that there are basically three DoD networks. The first, NIPRNET, is
the unclassified intranet. Systems on that network use the dot-mil addresses. The NIPRNET
connects to the public Internet at sixteen nodes. While it is unclassified data that moves on
NIPRNET, unclassified does not mean unimportant. Most logistical information, like supplying
Army units with food, is on the NIPRNET. Most U.S. military units cannot sustain themselves for
long without support from private-sector companies, and most of that communication goes
Page 83
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
through the NIPRNET.
The second DoD network is called SIPRNET and is used to pass secret-level classified
information. Many military orders are transmitted over the SIPRNET. There is supposed to be
an â  air gapâ between the unclassified and secret-level networks. Users of the classified network
download things from the Internet and upload them to the SIPRNET, thus sometimes passing
malware along unknowingly. Pentagon information security specialists call this problem the
â  sneakernet threat.â
In November 2008, a Russian-origin piece of spyware began looking around cyberspace for
dot-mil addresses, the unclassified NIPRNET. Once the spyware hacked its way into NIPRNET
computers, it began looking for thumb drives and downloaded itself onto them. Then the
â  sneakernet effectâ kicked in. Some of those thumb drives were then inserted by their users into
classified computers on the SIPRNET. So much for the air gap. Because the secret network is
not supposed to be connected to the Internet, it is not supposed to get viruses or worms.
Therefore, most of the computers on the network had no antivirus protection, no desktop
firewalls or similar security software. In short, computers on DoDâ s most important network had
less protection than you probably have on your home computer.
Within hours, the spyware had infected thousands of secret-level U.S. military computers in
Afghanistan, Iraq, Qatar, and elsewhere in the Central Command. Within a few more hours, the
highest-ranking U.S. military officer, Admiral Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, was realizing how vulnerable his military really was. According to a high-ranking Pentagon
source, Mullen screamed, â  You mean to tell me that I canâ t rely on our operational network?â at
the network specialists briefing him. The network experts on the Joint Staff acknowledged the
Admiralâ s conclusion. They did not seem surprised; hadnâ t he known that already? Horrified at a
huge weakness that Majors and Captains seemed to take for granted, but which had been kept
from him, Mullen looked around for a senior officer. â  Whereâ s the J-3?â he demanded, looking
for the Director of Operations. â  Does he know this?â
Shortly thereafter, Mullen and his boss, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, were explaining
their discovery to President Bush. The SIPRNET was probably compromised. The netcentric
advantage the U.S. military thought it enjoyed might just prove to be its Achillesâ  heel. Perhaps
Mullen should not have been surprised. There are over 100,000 SIPRNET terminals around the
world. If you can get time alone with one terminal for a few minutes, you can upload malware or
run a covert connection to the Internet. One friend of mine described a SIPRNET terminal in the
Balkans that a Russian â  peacekeeperâ could easily get to without being observed. Just as in
World War II, when the Allies needed only one German Enigma code machine in order to break
the Nazisâ  encryption, so, too, if one SIPRNET terminal is compromised, can malware be
inserted that could affect the entire network. Several experts who worked on SIPRNET
security-related issues confirmed to me the scary conclusion. As one said, â  You got to assume
that itâ s not going to work when we need it.â He explained that if, in a crisis, that command and
control network were brought down by an enemy, or, worse, if the enemy issued bogus
commands, â  the U.S. military would be severely disadvantaged.â Thatâ s putting it mildly.
The third major DoD network is the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information
(TS/SCI) network called JWICS. This more limited network is designed to pass along
intelligence information to the military. Its terminals are in special highly secured rooms known as
Secret Compartmentalized Information Facilities, or SCIFs. People also refer to those rooms as
â  the vault.â Access to these terminals is more restricted because of their location, but the
information flowing on the network still has to go across fiber-optic cables and through routers
and servers, just as with any other network. Routers can be attacked to cut communications. The
hardware used in computers, servers, routers, and switches can all be compromised at the point
of manufacture or later on. Therefore, we cannot assume that even this network is reliable.
Under the CNCI plan, DoD is embarked on an extensive program to upgrade security on all
three kinds of networks. Some of what is being done is classified, much of it is expensive, and
Page 84
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
some of it will take a long time. A real possibility is the use of high-bandwidth lasers to carry
communications to and from satellites. Assuming the satellites were secure from hacking, such a
system would reduce the vulnerabilities associated with fiber-optic cable and routers strung out
around the world. There are, however, a few important design concepts using currently available
technology that should be included in the DoD upgrade program quickly, and they are not budget
busters:
ï· in addition to protecting the network itself, guard the end points; install
desktop firewalls and antivirus and intrusion-prevention software on all
computers on all DoD networks, whether or not they are connected to
the Internet;
ï· require all users on all DoD networks to prove who they are when they
sign on through at least two factors of authentication;
ï· segment the networks into subnets with limited â  need to knowâ access
rules for connecting out of the subnets;
ï· go beyond the current limited practice of bulk encrypting, which
scrambles all traffic as it moves on trunk fiber cables, and encrypt all
files on all computers, including data at rest in data-storage servers;
ï· monitor all networks for new unauthorized connections to the network,
automatically shutting off unknown devices.
Even if its networks are secure, DoD runs the risk that the software and/or hardware it
has running its weapons systems may be compromised. We know the plans for the new
F-35 fighter were stolen by hack into a defense contractor. What if the hacker also
added to the plans, perhaps a hidden program that causes the aircraft to malfunction in
the air when it receives a certain command that could be radioed in from an enemy
fighter? Logic bombs like that can be hidden in the millions of lines of code on the F-35,
or in the many pieces of firmware and computer hardware that run the aircraft. As one
pilot told me, â  Aircraft these days, whether itâ s the F-22 Raptor or the Boeing 787â ¦all
they are is a bunch of software that happens to be flying through the air. Mess with the
software and it stops flying through the air.â I thought of the Air France Airbus that
crashed in the South Atlantic because its computer made a wrong decision.
The computer chips U.S. weapons use, as well as some of the computers or their
components, are made in other countries. DoDâ s most ubiquitous operating system is
Microsoft Windows, which is developed around the world on development networks
that have proven vulnerable in the past. This supply-chain concern is not easily or quickly
solved. It is one of the areas that the 2008 Bush plan focused on. New chip factories, or
fabs, are being built in the U.S. Some private-sector companies are developing software
to check other software for bugs. In addition to adding quickly to the security of its
networks, one of the most important things the Pentagon could do would be to develop a
rigorous standards, inspection, and research program to ensure that the software and
hardware being used in key weapons systems, in command control, and in logistics are
not laced with trapdoors or logic bombs.
So thatâ s the Defensive Triad strategy. If the Obama Administration and the Congress
were to agree to harden the Internet backbone, separate and secure the controls for the
power grid, and vigorously pursue security upgrades for Defense IT systems, we could
cast doubt in the minds of potential nation-state attackers about how well they would do
in launching a large-scale attack against us. And even if they did attack, the Defensive
Triad could mitigate the effects. It is admittedly difficult to measure the financial cost of
these programs at this point in their development, but in terms of implementation
difficulty, they could all be phased in over five years. If implemented with the thought in
mind that we want to be able to derive some benefit from the improvements even before
they are fully deployed, there could be a steady increase over those five years in the
Page 85
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
degree of difficulty for a nation-state thinking about cyber war against us. Unless and until
this plan or some similar defensive strategy that includes the private-sector networks is
implemented, being in a cyber war would probably not be good news for the United
States.
If we do the Defensive Triad, we will have the credibility to say some things that will
add further to our ability to deter cyber attack. Sometimes just saying things, things that
do not always cost money, can buy you added security, if you have credibility. The
capstone of the triad is our â  declaratory postureâ toward those nation-states that would
think about attacking us through cyberspace. A declaratory posture is a formally
articulated statement of the policy and intention of the government. We do not have an
authoritatively articulated policy today about how we would regard a cyber attack and
what we would do in response. Some in the councils of a potential attacker could argue
that the U.S. response to a cyber attack might be fairly minimal, or confused.
We do not want to be in a situation similar to what John Kennedy found himself in 
after he discovered that there were nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba. He declared that
any such missile fired by anyone (Russian or Cuban) from Cuba toward â  any nation in
this hemisphere would be regarded as an attack, by the Soviet Union, upon the United
States, requiring a full retaliatory response.â Those words were chilling when I first heard
them as a twelve-year-old; they remain so today. If the U.S. had said that before the
missiles went to Cuba, the Kremlin might not have sent them.
A public declaration about what we would do in case of a cyber attack should,
however, not limit future decisions. There needs to be a certain â  constructive ambiguityâ
in what is said. In the event of a major cyber attack, there will likely be an unhelpful
ambiguity about who attacked us, and our declaratory policy needs to take that into
account as well. Imagine, then, Barack Obama addressing the graduating class of one of
the four U.S. military academies, something he will do four times in his first term in office.
He looks out on the sea of uniformed new officers and their parents, describes the
phenomenon of cyber war, and then says: â  So let me make this clear to any nation that
may contemplate using cyber weapons against us. The United States will regard a cyber
attack that disrupts or damages our military, our government, or our critical infrastructure
as we would a kinetic attack that had the same target and the same effect. We would
consider it a hostile act in our territory. In response to such aggression in our cyberspace,
I, as Commander in Chief, will draw upon the full panoply of power available to the
United States of America and will not be limited as to the size or nature of our response
by those characteristics of the attack upon us.â
â  Panoply of powerâ is a presidential phrase. It says he may respond with diplomatic,
economic, cybernetic, or kinetic means, as he chooses and as appropriate, taking into
account the target and the effect. International lawyers will quibble about the â  not be
limitedâ line, noting that defensive responses are supposed by international law
conventions to be commensurate with the attack. Suggesting the response might be
incommensurate, however, adds to deterrence. In nuclear strategy this idea was called
â  escalation dominanceââ responding to a lower-level attack by moving rapidly up the
escalation ladder and then saying that the hostilities must end. It sends the message that
you are not willing to engage in some prolonged, slow-bleeding conflict. It is an option
that the President must have, whether or not he uses it.
What if, as is likely, the attribution problem occurs and the attacker hides behind the
skirts of â  citizen hacktivistsâ or claims the attack merely transited their country, but did
not originate there? Anticipating this claim in advance, Obama pauses in his address and
then adds, â  Nor will we be fooled by claims that a cyber attack was the work of citizen
hacktivists or that attribution is uncertain. We have the capability to determine attribution
to the degree necessary. Moreover, we reserve the right to consider a refusal to stop, in
Page 86

a timely manner, an attack emanating from a country as the equivalent of the government
of that country engaging in the attack. We will also judge a lack of serious cooperation in
investigations of attacks as the equivalent of participation in the attack.â
The Obama Doctrine would be one of cyber equivalency, in which cyber attacks are
to be judged by their effects, not their means. They would be judged as if they were
kinetic attacks, and may be responded to by kinetic attacks, or other means. The
corollary is that nations have a national cyberspace accountability and an obligation
to assist, meaning that they would have a responsibility to prevent hostile action coming
from servers in their country and must promptly hunt down, shut off, and bring to justice
those who use their cyberspace to disrupt or damage systems elsewhere. America would
also have these obligations and would have to shut off botnets attacking nations like
Georgia from places like Brooklyn. If the Tier 1 ISPs were scanning their networks, the 
obligation to assist would be fairly easy to carry out.
Were Obama or a future President to articulate such a doctrine, the United States
would have made clear that it regarded cyber attacks that disrupt or damage things not
as a lesser, more permissible form of national action just because they may not result in
colorful explosions or in piles of body bags. If the President also adopted something like
the Defensive Triad, the U.S. would finally have a credible cyber war defensive strategy.
So, once we have reasonable defenses in place, would we then be able to go on the
offensive, using our new cyber warriors to achieve military dominance of cyberspace for
the United States of America?

CHAPTER SIX
HOW OFFENSIVE?
In the seminal 1983 movie about computers and war, War Games, starring a young Matthew
Broderick, the tinny computer voice asked haltingly, â  Do you want to play a game of thermonuclear
war?â Why donâ t we play a game of cyber war in order to elucidate some of the policy choices that
shape a strategy. DoD runs such exercises, called Cyber Storm, annually. The CIAâ s annual cyber war
exercise, Silent Horizon, has been happening since 2007. For the purposes of this analysis, Iâ ll make the
same request of you that I made of students at Harvardâ s Kennedy School and national security
bureaucrats sitting around the White House Situation Room conference table: â  Donâ t fight the scenario.â
By that I mean, do not spend a lot of time rejecting the premise that circumstances could happen
someday that would result in the U.S. being on the edge of conflict with Russia or China.
When U.S. cyber warriors talk about the â  big one,â they usually have in mind a conflict in cyberspace
with Russia or China, the two nations with the most sophisticated offensive capability other than the U.S.
No one wants hostilities with those countries to happen. Thinking about it, for the purposes of
understanding what cyber war would look like, does not make it more likely. In fact, by understanding
the risks of our current cyber war posture, we might reduce the chances of a real cyber war. And if,
despite our intentions, a cyber war does happen, it would be best to have thought in advance about how
it could unravel.
Certainly, I did not want to see the attack of 9/11 happen, but I had chaired countless â  tabletop
exercises,â or war game scenarios, to get myself and the bureaucracy ready in case something like it did
happen. When it came, we had already thought through how to respond on the day of an attack and the
few days thereafter. We spent enormous effort to try to prevent attacks, but we also devoted some time
to thinking about what we would do if one succeeded. Had we not done so, that awful day would have
been even worse. So, in that spirit of learning by visualizing, letâ s think about a period of rising tensions
between the U.S. and China.
Letâ s call it Exercise South China Sea and set it a few years in the future. Not much has changed,
except China has increased its dependence on the Net somewhat. For its part, the U.S. has not done
much to improve its cyber defenses. We will have three teams, U.S. Cyber Command, the Chinese
Peopleâ s Liberation Army (PLA) Cyber Division, and the Controllers, who play the part of everyone
else. The Controllers also decide what happens as a result of the other two teamsâ  moves. Letâ s say for
the sake of the exercise that China has been aggressively pressing Vietnam and other ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries to cede their rights to a vast and rich undersea area
of gas and oil fields. (China has, in fact, claimed waters that run hundreds of miles to its south, along the
coasts of Vietnam and the Philippines.) We will stipulate that there have been small clashes between their
navies. In an irony of history, we will say that the government of Vietnam has asked the U.S. for military
support, as have other nations in the region with claims on the contested waters. In response, the
President has authorized a joint U.S.-ASEAN naval exercise and has dispatched two U.S. carrier battle
groups, about twenty ships, including about 150 aircraft and several submarines. China and the U.S. have
exchanged diplomatic notes and public pronouncements, with both countries essentially saying that the
other one should stay out of the issue. American cable news networks have at this point started showing
dramatic slides with the words â  South China Sea Crisis.â
As our hypothetical exercise opens at Fort Meade, the team playing Cyber Command has been
ordered by the Pentagon to prepare a series of steps it could take as the political situation escalates. The
order from the Secretary of Defense is to develop options to:
First, dissuade the Chinese government from acting militarily over the contested waters. Second, failing
that, to reduce to the maximum extent possible the ability of the Chinese military to pose a risk to U.S.
and allied forces in the area. Third, in the event of increased tensions or the outbreak of hostilities, to
be able to disrupt the Chinese military more broadly to reduce its ability to project force. Fourth, to
occupy the Chinese leadership with disruption of their domestic infrastructure to the extent that it may
Page 88
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
cause popular and Party questioning of the Chinese governmentâ s aggressive behavior abroad. Fifth,
throughout this period Cyber Command is to work with appropriate U.S. government agencies to
prevent Chinese-government or Chinese-inspired cyber attacks on the U.S. military or significant U.S.
infrastructure.
In this situation, the team playing Cyber Command in the tabletop exercise faces a dilemma. They do
not want to expose all of the cyber attack techniques, or â  exploits,â that they have developed. Once an
exploit is used, cyber defenders will devote the time and energy necessary to figure out how to block it in
the future. While the defenders will not fix all of the systems that could be exploited, they will patch
enough of the important systems that the attack technique will have lost much of its potency. Thus, Cyber
Command will want to withhold its most clever attacks. If they wait, however, the Chinese may have
done things that make it far more difficult for the U.S. to execute cyber attacks.
As tensions begin to mount, China will reduce the flow of packets into China and will scan and filter
for possible U.S. attacks the ones it permits in. Then it may drop connectivity to the outside world
altogether. If the U.S. has not already launched its cyber attack, it will be much harder to get around the
Great Firewall of China. Cyber Command will have to have created, in advance, tunnels into Chinese
cyberspace, perhaps by hiding satellite telephones in China to download attacks and insert them into the
Internet behind the Wall. Or perhaps Cyber Command will, working with CIA, have placed agents inside
China with the attack tools already on their laptops.
If the U.S. waits to use its best weapons, China may make it difficult to launch an attack from U.S.
cyberspace by confusing or crashing our cyberspace and Internet backbone. Scrambling data on the
highest-echelon servers of the Domain Name System, which provides the Internet addresses of websites,
or doing so on the routing tables (the Border Gateway Protocol lists) of the Tier 1 backbone providers
will disrupt U.S. cyberspace for days. The effect would be to send traffic more or less randomly to the
wrong place on the Internet. As noted in chapter 3, very little prevents this from happening now since
these software programs that make the Internet run do not require that there be any checking to see if the
commands issued are authentic.
If the Chinese could get agents into the big windowless buildings where all the Tier 1 ISPs link to each
other, the so-called peering points, or into any place on the Tier 1 ISP networks, they could possibly
issue commands directly to the routers that do the switching and directing of traffic on the Internet and in
the rest of cyberspace. Even though DoD and U.S. intelligence agencies have their own channels in
cyberspace separate from the public Internet, their traffic is likely to be carried on the same fiber-optic
cable pipes as the public Internet. The public Internet may just be a different â  colorâ on the same fiber or
maybe a different fiber in the same pipe. Chances are that there are many places where the DoD and
intelligence-agency traffic is running through the same routers as the public Internet. As discussed earlier,
China is very familiar with the routers. Most of them are made by the U.S. firm Cisco, but made in China.
All of that Chinese potential to disrupt the Internet and stop the U.S. from being able to send cyber
attacks out means that the Cyber Command team has an incentive in the early stages of a crisis to store
their attacks on networks outside of the U.S. Of course, doing so broadens the global involvement in the
pending cyber war.
To begin operations, the team playing Cyber Command decides to signal their involvement with the
hope of deterring China from engaging in further military operations. The act that Cyber Command
conducts must be deniable publicly, but Chinese authorities must know it was no accident. The signal
must demonstrate an ability to do things that are technically hard and which are significant enough for the
Chinese leadership to notice, but without being so damaging as to provoke a full-scale cyber war.
Having hacked their way into the closed Chinese military intranet, they send around to senior officers a
doctored picture of Chinaâ s one aircraft carrier, but in this Photoshopped version the ship is in flames and
sinking. The not-so-subtle message is that the pride of Chinaâ s navy, its one carrier, could easily be sunk
by the 7th Fleet, causing great loss of face to the Chinese military; maybe itâ s better not to get into what
could prove to be such an embarrassing fight.
U.S. intelligence then learns that the Chinese are loading up their South Sea Fleet for an amphibious
landing on disputed islands in the South China Sea. Cyber Command is asked by the Pentagon to buy
Page 89
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
some time, to slow down the Chinese landings by disrupting the troops and supplies getting ready to load
up on the ships still in port. The Chinese South Sea Fleet is headquartered in Zhanjiang, on the Leizhou
Peninsula, and its air force supporting operations in the South China Sea is on Hainan, in the Tonkin Gulf.
The Fleet Headquarters and the Naval Air Base do not have their own electric grid; they are connected
to the public power system. They do not have their own large generators, just smaller emergency backup
units.
Using its subordinate unit, the 10th Fleet, Cyber Command utilizes a preexisting trapdoor in the
Chinese power grid and accesses the local electric gridâ s controls. Once in the control system, they issue
signals that cause surges, tripping breakers that shut down transmission and stop generators. The
Americans do not cause the generators or transformers to damage themselves.
The team playing China in our hypothetical exercise realizes that the blackout was caused by an
intrusion and orders a trace on the attack. It is traced back to an ISP in Estonia, where the trail goes
cold. No one in Beijing would think a hacker in Estonia is the real attacker. Thus the signal is sent, but in
a deniable way. The signal does get the Chinese teamâ s attention. They are informed that the blackout on
the Leizhou Peninsula tripped a cascade that knocked out all of Guangdong (formerly Canton) Province,
leaving slightly more than a hundred million Chinese in the dark for almost twenty-four hours. Hong Kong
was also affected. The Politburo considers the blackout an escalatory step and asks the team playing the
cyber warfare division of the PLA for options to respond.
The PLA team recommends China respond in a somewhat commensurate manner, going after cities
with Navy bases, but they want to do more as well, to send the U.S. the message that they can hurt us
more than we can hurt them. The Politburo approves all six steps proposed by their cyber warriors:
1. ordering the South Sea Fleet reinforced and moving more aircraft to Hainan
and the southern coast airfields;
2. directing the Chinese submarine squadron at Yulin, on Hainan Island, to go to
sea;
3. activating logic bombs already planted in the power grids in Honolulu, San
Diego, and Bremerton, in the state of Washington, three cities where much of
the U.S. Pacific Fleet is located (and although the Chinese do not know it, the
blackouts will extend into Tijuana, Mexico, and up to Vancouver, British
Columbia);
4. disrupting the unclassified DoD network by launching a new,
never-before-seen worm (a Zero Day exploit) that infects one machine after
another and causes their hard drives to be erased (the attack is launched from
inside the DoD intranet);
5. attacking the Estonian ISP from which the attack on the Chinese power grid
appears to have originated; and
6. causing a power blackout in Yokosuka and the surrounding area in Japan
where the U.S. 7th Fleet is headquartered.
At the beginning of the next move in the exercise, with tensions escalating, Cyber Command is
informed that China is about to stop Internet traffic from the outside world. The Fort Meade
team, therefore, proposes to the Pentagon that it be authorized to launch two more waves of
cyber attack and be prepared to launch a third. The two attacks would be on the Chinese air
defense network and on the national military command control system. These attacks would use
highly secret exploits and activate logic bombs already planted in these networks. In the wings
would be a broad attack on the Chinese rail network, air traffic control, the banking system, and
the hardware of the power grid (generators and transformers).
Somewhat to their surprise, the Cyber Command team receives instructions from the Control
Team playing the White House and Pentagon to avoid attacks on the military command and
control system and on defensive weapons like air defense. The Cyber Command planners are
also told to avoid both the air traffic control system and the banking sector.
As the Cyber Command team is reformulating its next move, databases at the Security
Page 90
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Industries Automation Corporation and the Deposit Trust in New York are reported to be
seriously damaged and corrupted. Data has also been badly scrambled at CSX, Union Pacific,
and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroads, as well as at United, Delta, and American
Airlines. As a result, the New York Stock Exchange has closed, freight trains have stopped, and
aircraft are sitting at gates across the country. The Defense Information Systems Agency, which
runs DoDâ s internal networks, declares an emergency because both the secret-level SIPRNET
and the top-secret JWICS networks have been disrupted by fast-spreading worms that are
crashing hard drives. None of these attacks originated overseas, and therefore U.S. intelligence
and Cyber Command did not see them coming and could not stop them before they got to the
U.S. The attacks appear to have used new, not previously employed techniques, and thus Cyber
Command was unable to block them by scanning for the signatures of past attacks.
With attacks on Chinese air defense, banking, national military command and control, and air
traffic control ruled out by higher authorities, the team playing U.S. Cyber Command has fewer
options than it thought it would. Moreover, because U.S. Cyber Command has a defensive role
in protecting DoD networks, some of the team members are removed to deal with the worms
working their destructive path through the Defense Department. In light of the significant
escalation that the Chinese team utilized in its first move, the U.S. team opts to launch a
nationwide power blackout in China, including targeted attacks to damage several large
generators. At the same time, they will try to cause a maximum number of freight-train
derailments and jumble the database of the rail system. To replace the military targets that have
been ruled out by their superiors, the U.S. team decides to attack the communications satellite
used by the Chinese navy and the navyâ s logistics network.
The Control Teamâ s report on the effects of the second round of U.S. attacks is not good
news. China had disconnected its networks from the global Internet, thus limiting the impact of
the U.S. attack. Moreover, when the U.S. first attacked the power grid, Beijing had ordered all
remaining sectors of the electric grid to go to a defensive posture that disconnected Internet links
and broke up regional grids into â  islandsâ to prevent cascading blackouts. Only a few of the
generators targeted by the U.S. can be hit and their destruction will cause only isolated outages.
At the same time that defenses were raised elsewhere, the rail system shifted to a manual,
radio-based control system. Therefore the attempted second attack on the freight-rail system by
the U.S. did not work.
The U.S. hacked the Chinese communications satellite, causing its station-keeping thrusters to
fire until all fuel was spent and sending it in the direction of Jupiter. Within an hour, however, the
Chinese navy has activated a backup, encrypted radio Teletype system. But the U.S. attack on
the Chinese navy logistics computer network is successful and, together with the regional power
blackout, has slowed the boarding of Chinese troops onto ships. The Control Team also reports
that a Chinese submarine has surfaced between the two U.S. aircraft carriers. It had penetrated
the defensive perimeter, similar to an incident that actually happened in 2009 when a Song-class
submarine appeared next to the carrier USS Kitty Hawk. By surfacing, the sub has given away
its location, but it has also sent a message to the U.S. that the location of the carriers is known
with precision, making it possible for China to flood the area with air- and ground-launched
cruise missiles if shooting starts.
At this point, the U.S. Cyber Command team is informed that the White House has ordered
the two U.S. carrier battle groups to proceed toward Australia. The State Department will be
sending a high-level team to Beijing to discuss its territorial claims. Cyber Command has been
ordered to cease offensive action.
The game is over.
After every tabletop exercise in the government, there is a gathering of controllers and players
called â  the hot wash.â It is a time to write down lessons learned and to make note of areas for
further study. So what did we learn from Exercise South China Sea? What issues did it highlight?
Ten important cyber war issues emerged from the playersâ  conduct of the simulation: the use of
Page 91
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
deterrence; the concept of going first; the prewar preparation of the battlefield; the global spread
of a regional conflict; collateral damage; escalatory control; accidental war; attribution; crisis
instability; and defensive asymmetry. Letâ s look at each in turn.
1. DETERRENCE
Obviously, in this case deterrence failed. In our hypothetical scenario, the Cyber Command team
was not deterred by considerations of what China might do to the U.S. In the real world, the
U.S. probably should be deterred from initiating large-scale cyber warfare for fear of the
asymmetrical effects that retaliation could have on American networks. Yet, deterrence is an
undeveloped theoretical space in cyber war today. Deterrence theory was the underpinning of
U.S., Soviet, and NATO nuclear strategy during the Cold War. The horror that could be caused
by nuclear weapons (and the fear that any use would lead to extensive use) deterred
nuclear-weapons nations from using their ultimate weapons against each other. It also deterred
nations, both nuclear-armed and not, from doing anything that might provoke a nuclear response.
Strategists developed complex theories about nuclear deterrence. Herman Kahn developed a
typology with three distinct classes of nuclear deterrence in his works in the 1960s. His theories
and analyses were widely studied by civilian and military leaders in both the United States and the
Soviet Union. His clear, matter-of-fact writing about the likely scope of destruction in books like 
On Thermonuclear War (1960) and Thinking About the Unthinkable (1962) undoubtedly
helped to deter nuclear war.
Of all the nuclear-strategy concepts, however, deterrence theory is probably the least
transferable to cyber war. Indeed, deterrence in cyberspace is likely to have a very different
meaning than it did in the works of Kahn and the 1960s strategists. Nuclear deterrence was
based on the credible effects created by nuclear weapons. The world had seen what two nuclear
weapons had done to Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Much larger nuclear weapons had then
been detonated aboveground by the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1940s and 1950s,
followed by the United Kingdom in 1952, France in 1960, and China in 1968. All told, the initial
five nuclear-weapons states detonated over 2,300 weapons above and below the surface.
No one knew exactly what would happen if either the United States or the Soviet Union tried
to launch several hundred nuclear-armed ballistic missiles more or less simultaneously, but
internally the American military thought that over 90 percent of its missiles would launch, make it
to their targets, and detonate their weapons. They had similarly high expectations that they knew
what the effects of their weapons would be on the targets. To insure a major attack would work,
if attempted, the U.S. military planned on hitting important targets with nuclear warheads from
three different delivery mechanisms (bombs from aircraft, warheads from ground-based missiles,
and warheads from submarine-launched missiles). Both superpowers deployed their forces in
such a way that they would have many surviving nuclear weapons even after suffering a large,
surprise attack. Retaliation was assured. Thus, there was near certainty that by one sideâ s using
nuclear weapons, it was inviting some degree of its own nuclear destruction. What would happen
after a massive exchange of nuclear weapons was subject to debate, but few doubted that the
two nuclear combatants would have inflicted on each other a level of damage unparalleled in
human history. Many believed a large-scale exchange would trigger a â  nuclear winterâ that could
cause the end of all human life. Almost all experts believed that a large-scale exchange by the two
superpowers would cause what were termed â  prompt deathsâ in the scores of millions. (Kahn
dryly noted, â  No one wants to be the first to kill a hundred million people.â) Any use of nuclear
weapons, it was feared, could escalate unpredictably into large-scale use. That fear has deterred
the United States and the Soviet Union from using their nuclear weapons for over six decades to
date.
The nuclear tests had created what was called a â  demonstration effect.â Some theorists also
suggested that in a major crisis, such as a conventional war in Europe, the United States might
detonate a nuclear weapon at sea as another demonstration effect, thus signaling that unless the
Page 92
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
fighting stopped, the NATO Alliance was prepared to escalate to nuclear-weapons use. NATO
planned that during a conventional war it could â  signal NATOâ s intentâ by such a warning shot.
Despite the instances of cyber war to date, the demonstration effect has not been compelling. As
discussed earlier, most of the cyber incidents thus far have been either unsophisticated attacks
such as a DDOS or covert penetrations of networks to steal information or implant trapdoors
and logic bombs. The limited effects of the DDOS attacks were not widely noticed by those
outside of the countries victimized. And in the case of most of the covert attacks, even the victims
may not have noticed.
So what confidence do cyber warriors have that their weapons will work, and what
expectation do they have about the effects that would be caused by the weapons? What they
undoubtedly know is that they have already used many of their attack techniques to successfully
penetrate other nationsâ  networks. They have probably done everything short of a few
keystrokes of what they would do in real cyber war. On simulations of enemy networks, they
have probably engaged in destructive operations. The Aurora test on the generator in Idaho was
one such test. It left the experimenters confident that they could have caused the physical
destruction of a large electric generator with a cyber weapon.
What cyber warriors cannot know, however, is whether the nation they are targeting will
surprise them with a significantly improved array of defenses in a crisis. What would be the effect
if China disconnected its networks from international cyberspace? Would the U.S. plans for
dealing with that contingency work? Assuming Russia has placed trapdoors and logic bombs in
U.S. networks, how do they know whether the Americans have identified them and have planned
their elimination in a period of heightened tension? When a cyber warrior goes to use the
penetration technique he has planned on to get back into a target, that route of access may be
blocked and an unexpected and effective intrusion-prevention system may suddenly have
appeared. Unlike a national antimissile system, an intrusion-prevention for key networks could
easily be kept secret until activated. If the cyber warriorâ s job is to shut down an enemyâ s air
defense system slightly in advance of his nationâ s air force doing a bombing mission, the bombers
may be in for a rude awakening. The radar installations and missiles that were supposed to have
been shut down may suddenly come alive and destroy the attacking aircraft.
With a nuclear detonation, one could be fairly certain about what would happen to the target.
If the target was a military base, it would become unusable for years, if not forever. On my first
day of graduate school at MIT in the 1970s, I was given a circular slide rule, which was a
nuclear-effect calculator. Spin one circle and you picked the nuclear yield, say 200 kilotons. Spin
another circle and you could choose an airburst or a groundburst. Throw in how far away from
the target you might be in a worst case and your handy little spinning device told you how many
pounds of explosive pressure per square inch would be created and how many would be needed
to collapse a hardened underground missile silo in on itself, before becoming little radioactive
pieces of dust thrown way up in the atmosphere. A cyber warrior may possibly have similar
certainty that were he to hit some system with a sophisticated cyber weapon, that system, say a
modern freight railroad, would likely stop cold. What he may not know is whether the railroad
has a reliable resiliency plan, a backup command-and-control network that he does not know
about because the enemy is keeping it secret and not using it until itâ s needed. Just as a secret
intrusion-prevention system might surprise us when itâ s suddenly turned on in a crisis, a secret
continuity-of-operations system that could quickly get the target back up and running is also a
form of defense against cyber attack.
The potential surprise capability of an opponentâ s defense makes deterrence in cyber war
theory fundamentally different from deterrence theory in nuclear strategy. It was abundantly clear
in nuclear strategy that there was an overwhelming case of what was called â  offensive
preference,â that is to say, any defense deployed or even devised could easily be overwhelmed
by a well-timed surprise attack. It costs far less to modify oneâ s missile offense to deal with
defensive measures than the huge costs necessary to achieve even minimally effective missile
Page 93
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
protection. Whatever the defense did, the offense won with little additional effort. In addition, no
one thought for a moment that the Soviet Union or the United States could secretly develop and
deploy an effective missile-defense system. Ronald Reagan hoped that by spending billions of
dollars on research, the U.S. could change the equation and make strategic nuclear missile
defense possible. Decades later it has not worked, and today the U.S. hopes, at best, to be able
to stop a small missile attack launched by accident or a minor powerâ s attack with primitive
missiles. Even that remains doubtful.
In strategic nuclear war theory, the destructive power of the offense was well known, no
defense could do much to stop it, the offense was feared, and nations were thereby deterred
from using their own nuclear weapons or taking other provocative steps that might trigger a
nuclear response. Deterrence derived from sufficient certainty. In the case of cyber war, the
power of the offense is largely secret; defenses of some efficacy could possibly be created and
might even appear suddenly in a crisis, but it is unlikely any nation is effectively deterred today
from using its own cyber weapons in a crisis; and the potential of retaliation with cyber weapons
probably does not yet deter any nation from pursuing whatever policy it has in mind.
Assume for the sake of discussion that the United States (or some other nation) had such
powerful offensive cyber weapons that it could overcome any defense and inflict significant
disruption and damage on some nationâ s military and economy. If the U.S. simply announced that
it had that capability, but disclosed no details, many opponents would think that we were bluffing.
Without details, without ever having seen U.S. cyber weapons in action, few would so fear what
we could do as to be deterred from anything.
The U.S. could theoretically look for an opportunity to punish some bad actor nation with a
cyber attack just to create a demonstration effect. (The U.S. used the F-117 Stealth
fighter-bomber in the 1989 invasion of Panama not because it feared Panamanian air defenses,
but because the Pentagon wanted to show off its new weapon to deter others. The invasion was
code-named Operation Just Cause, and many in the Pentagon quipped that the F-117 was sent
in â  just cause we could.â) The problem with the idea of using cyber weapons in the next crisis
that comes up is that many sophisticated cyber attack techniques may be similar to the
cryptologistâ s â  onetime padâ in that they are designed for use only once. When the cyber attack
weapons are used, potential opponents are likely to detect them and apply all of their research
capability in coming up with a defense.
If the U.S. cannot deter others with its secret cyber weapons, is it possible that the U.S. itself
may be deterred by the threat from other nationsâ  cyber warriors? In other words, are we today
self-deterred from conventional military operations because of our cyber war vulnerabilities? If a
crisis developed in the South China Sea, as in the exercise described above, I doubt that today
anyone around the table in the Situation Room would say to the President, â  You better not send
those aircraft carriers to get China to back down in that oil dispute. If you do that, Mr. President,
Beijing could launch a cyber attack to crash our stock market, ground our airlines, halt our trains,
and plunge our cities into a sustained blackout. There is nothing we have today that could stop
them, sir.â
Somebody should say that, because, of course, itâ s true. But would they? Very unlikely. The
most senior American military officer just learned less than two years ago that his operational
network could probably be taken down by a cyber attack. The Obama White House did not get
around for a year to appointing a â  cyber czar.â Americaâ s warriors think of technology as the ace
up their sleeves, something that lets their aircraft and ships and tanks operate better than any in
the world. It comes hard to most of the U.S. military to think of technology as something that
another nation could use effectively against us, especially when that technology is some geekâ s
computer code and not a stealthy fighter-bomber.
So, we cannot deter other nations with our cyber weapons. In fact, other nations are so
undeterred that they are regularly hacking into our networks. Nor are we likely to be deterred
from doing things that might provoke others into making a major cyber attack. Deterrence is only
Page 94
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
a potential, something that we might create in the mind of possible cyber attackers if (and it is a
huge if) we got serious about deploying effective defenses for some key networks. Since we have
not even started to do that, deterrence theory, the sine qua non of strategic nuclear war
prevention, plays no significant role in stopping cyber war today.
2. NO FIRST USE?
One of the first things you should have noticed about the scenario in our hypothetical exercise
was the idea of going first. In the absence of any strategy to the contrary, the U.S. side in the
hypothetical exercise took the first move in cyberspace by sending out an insulting e-mail on what
China thought was its internal military e-mail system and then by initiating what the U.S. team
hoped would be a limited power blackout. The strategic goal was to signal both the seriousness
with which the U.S. viewed the crisis and the fact that the U.S. had some potent capabilities.
Cyber Commandâ s immediate tactical objective was to slow down the loading of the Chinese
amphibious assault force, to buy time for U.S. diplomats to talk China out of its planned
operation.
In nuclear war strategy, the Soviet Union proposed that we and they agree that neither side
would be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict. The U.S. government never agreed to the
No First Use Declaration, preserving for itself the option to use nuclear weapons to offset the
superior conventional forces of the Soviet Union. (My onetime State Department colleague Jerry
Kahan once asked a Soviet counterpart why they kept suggesting we ban orange juice. When
the Russian denied making such a proposal, Jerry retorted, â  But youâ re always running around
saying â no first juice.â â) Should we incorporate a No First Use approach in our cyber war
strategy?
There is no conventional military force in the world superior to that of the U.S., assuming that
the U.S. military is not blinded or disconnected by a cyber attack. Therefore, we do not need to
hold open the prospect of going first in cyberspace to compensate for some other deficiency, as
we did in nuclear strategy. Going first in cyber war also makes it more politically acceptable in
the eyes of the world for the victim of the cyber attack to retaliate in kind, and then some. Given
our greater vulnerability to cyber attack, the U.S. may not want to provoke a cyber phase to a
war.
However, forswearing the use of cyber weapons until they have been used on us could mean
that if a conventional war broke out, we would not defend our forces by such things as cyber
attacks on our opponentâ s antiaircraft missile systems. The initial use of cyber war in the South
China Sea scenario was a psychological operation on Chinaâ s internal military network, sending a
harassing e-mail with a picture of a sinking Chinese ship. Should that be considered a first use of
cyber war?
Moreover, the scenario presented a problem that if you do not go first in cyberspace, your
ability to conduct cyber attack may be reduced by the other side stepping up both its defensive
measures (for example, China cutting off its cyberspace from the rest of the world) and its
offensive measures (including attacks that disrupted U.S. networks that may be necessary for
some of the U.S. attacks to be launched). Whether we say it publicly or maintain it as an internal
component of our strategy, if we were to accept the concept of No First Use in cyber war we
would require a clear understanding of what constitutes â  use.â Is penetration of a network a
cyber war act? When the network penetration goes beyond just collecting information, does the
act then move from intelligence operations to cyber war? Any ban on â  first useâ would probably
only apply prior to kinetic shooting. Once a war goes kinetic, most bets are off.
3. PREPARATION OF THE BATTLEFIELD
Another thing that you should have caught is that it appears that both sides had hacked into each
otherâ s systems well before the exercise began. In the real world, they probably have actually
done just that. How much of this is done and who approves it is an issue to be reviewed when
creating a strategy.
Page 95
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
If CIA sends agents into a country to conduct a survey for possible future sabotage and they
leave behind a cache of weapons and explosives, under U.S. law such activity is considered
covert action and requires a Presidential finding and a formal notification of the two congressional
intelligence committees. In recent years, the Pentagon has taken the view that if it conducts some
kind of covert action, well, thatâ s just preparation of the battlefield and no one needs to know.
The phrase â  preparation of the battlefieldâ has become somewhat elastic. The battle does not
need to be imminent, and almost anyplace can be a battlefield someday.
This elasticity has also been applied to cyber war capability, and apparently not just by the
United States. In the hypothetical exercise, both the U.S. and China opened previously installed
trapdoors in the other countryâ s networks and then set off logic bombs that had been implanted
earlier in, among other places, the electric power grids. Beyond the exercise, there is good
reason to believe that someone actually has already implanted logic bombs in the U.S. power
grid control networks. Several people who should know implied or confirmed that the U.S. has
also already engaged in the same kind of preparation of the battlefield.
Imagine if the FBI announced that it had arrested dozens of Chinese government agents
running around the country strapping C4 explosive charges to those big, ugly high-tension
transmission line towers and to some of those unmanned step-down electric substation
transformers that dot the landscape. The nation would be in an outrage. Certain Congressmen
would demand that we declare war, or at least slap punitive tariffs on Chinese imports.
Somebody would insist that we start calling Chinese food â  liberty snacks.â Yet when the Wall
Street Journal announced in a headline in April 2009 that China had planted logic bombs in the
U.S. grid, there was little reaction. The difference in response is indicative mainly of the
Congress, the media, and the publicâ s inexperience with cyber war. It is not reflective of any real
distinction between the effects those logic bombs could have on the power grid, compared to
what little parcels of C4 explosives might do.
The implanting of logic bombs on networks such as the U.S. power grid cannot be justified as
an intelligence-collection operation. A nation might collect intelligence on our weapon systems by
hacking into Raytheonâ s or Boeingâ s network, but there is no informational value in being inside
Florida Power and Lightâ s control system. Even if there were valuable data on that network,
logic bombs do not collect information, they destroy it. The only reason to hack into a power grid
â s controls, install a trapdoor so you can get back in quickly later on, and leave behind computer
code that would, when activated, cause damage to the software (and even the hardware) of the
network, is if you are planning a cyber war. It does not mean that you have already decided to
conduct that war, but it certainly means that you want to be ready to do so.
Throughout much of the Cold War and even afterward there were urban legends about Soviet
agents sneaking into the U.S. with small nuclear weapons, so-called suitcase bombs, that could
wipe out U.S. cities even if Russian bombers and missiles were destroyed in some U.S. surprise
attack. While both the Soviets and the U.S. did have small weapons (we actually had a few
hundred called the Medium Atomic Demolition Munitions, or MADM, and another bunch called
the Small Atomic Demolition Munitions, or SADM, which were designed to be carried in a
backpack), there is no evidence that either side actually deployed them behind the otherâ s lines.
Even at the height of the Cold War, decision makers thought that actually sending the MADMs
out onto the streets would be too destabilizing.
How is it, then, that Chinese, and presumably U.S., decision makers have authorized placing
logic bombs on the territory of the other? It is at least possible that high-level officials in one or
both countries never approved the deployments and do not know about them. The cyber
weapons might have been implanted on the authority of military commanders acting under their
authority to engage in preparation of the battlefield. There is a risk that senior policy makers will
be told in a crisis that the other side has planted logic bombs in preparation for war and will view
that as a new and threatening development, causing the senior policy makers to ratchet up their
response in the crisis. Leaders may be told that since it is obvious the other side intends to crash
Page 96
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
our power grid, we should go first while we still can. Another risk is that the weapon may actually
be used without senior-level approval, either by a rogue commander or by some hacker or
disgruntled employee who discovers the weapon.
Cyber warriors justify the steps they have taken in preparation of the battlefield as necessary
measures to provide national decision makers with options in a future crisis. â  Would you want the
President to have fewer courses of action to choose from in some crisis?â they would say. â  If you
want him to have the choice of a nonkinetic response in the future, you have to let us get into their
networks now. Just because a network is vulnerable to unauthorized penetration now does not
mean it will be so years from now when we may want to get in.â
Networks are constantly being modified. An electric power transmission company might one
day buy an effective intrusion-prevention system (IPS) that would detect and block the
techniques we use to penetrate into the network. But if we can get into the network now, we can
leave behind a trapdoor that would appear to any future security system as an authorized entry.
Getting onto the network in the future is not enough, however; we want to be able to run code
that makes the system do what we want, to malfunction. That future IPS might block the
downloading of executable code, even by an authorized user, without some higher level of
approval. Thus, if we can get into the system now, we should leave behind the instruction code to
override surge protection or cause the generators to spin out of synchronization, or whatever
method we have to disrupt or destroy the network or the hardware it runs.
That sounds persuasive at one level, but are there places where we do not want our cyber
warriors preparing the battlefield?
4. GLOBAL WAR
In our hypothetical exercise, the Chinese response aimed at four U.S. navy facilities but spilled
over into several major cities in four countries. (The North American Interconnects link electric
power systems in the U.S., Canada, and parts of Mexico.)
To hide its tracks, the U.S., in this scenario, attacked the Chinese power grid from a computer
in Estonia. To get to China from Estonia, the U.S. attack packets would have had to traverse
several countries, including Russia. To discover the source of the attacks on them, the Chinese
would probably have hacked into the Russian routers from which the last packets came. In
response, China hit back at Estonia to make the point that nations that allow cyber attacks to
originate from their networks may end up getting punished even though they had not intentionally
originated the attack.
Even in an age of intercontinental missiles and aircraft, cyber war moves faster and crosses
borders more easily than any form of hostilities in history. Once a nation-state has initiated cyber
war, there is a high potential that other nations will be drawn in, as the attackers try to hide both
their identities and the routes taken by their attacks. Launching an attack from Estonian sites
would be like the U.S. landing attack aircraft in Mongolia without asking for permission, and
then, having refueled, taking off and bombing China. Because some attack tools, such as worms,
once launched into cyberspace can spread globally in minutes, there is the possibility of collateral
damage as these malicious programs jump international boundaries and affect unintended targets.
But what about collateral damage in the country that is being targeted?
5. COLLATERAL DAMAGE AND THE WITHHOLD DOCTRINE
Trying to strike at navy bases, the two cyber combatants hit the power plants providing the bases
electricity. In so doing, they left large regions and scores of millions of people in the dark because
electric power grids are extremely vulnerable to cascading failures that move in seconds. In such
a scenario there would probably be dozens of hospitals whose backup generators failed to start.
The international laws of war prohibit targeting hospitals and civilian targets in general, but it is
impossible to target a power grid without hitting civilian facilities. In the last U.S.-Iraq War, the
U.S. campaign of â  Shock and Aweâ employed precision-guided munitions that wiped out
targeted buildings and left structures across the street still standing. While being careful with
Page 97
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
bombs, the U.S. and other nations have developed cyber war weapons that have the potential to
be indiscriminate in their attacks.
In the cyber war game scenario, U.S. Cyber Command was denied permission to attack the
banking sector. In the real world, my own attempts to have NSA hack into banks to find and
steal al Qaedaâ s funds were repeatedly blocked by the leadership of the U.S. Treasury
Department in the Clinton Administration. Even in the Bush Administration, Treasury was able to
block a proposed hacking attack on Saddam Husseinâ s banks at the very time that the
administration was preparing an invasion and occupation in which over 100,000 Iraqis were
killed. Bankers have successfully argued that their international finance and trading system
depends upon a certain level of trust.
The U.S. decision to withhold attacks narrowly targeted on the financial sector also reflects an
understanding that the United States might be the biggest loser in a cyber war aimed at banks.
Even though the financial services sector is probably the most secure of all of the major industry
verticals in the U.S., it is still vulnerable. â  Weâ ve tested the security at more than a dozen top
U.S. financial institutions, as hired consultants, and weâ ve been able to hack in every time,â one
private-sector security consultant told me. â  And every time, we could have changed numbers
around and moved money, but we didnâ t.â
The existing U.S. policy does not prohibit hacking into foreign banks to collect intelligence, but
it does create a very high hurdle for altering data. Both the Secretary of the Treasury and the
Secretary of State have to personally authorize such an action. As far as I was able to determine
from my sources, that approval has never been granted. We have, in effect, what in nuclear war
strategy we called a â  withhold target set,â things that we have targeted but do not intend to hit.
That policy assumes, or hopes, that opponents will also play by those unarticulated rules. In
Exercise South China Sea, the PLA team did not. In its last move it hit the databases of the stock
market and the major bank clearing house. That was a dramatic and, we hope, unrealistic
escalation. Today Chinaâ s economy is so tightly connected to Americaâ s that they, too, might
have a withhold doctrine affecting the financial sector. Under foreseeable circumstances, it is
maybe an acceptable risk to assume that nations will all withhold data-altering attacks on the
financial sector, though some U.S. analysts would dispute that about China.
Because a sophisticated nonstate actor might not be so polite, it would be important for the
U.S. financial sector to have an advance understanding with the federal regulators about what
they would do if there were a major hack that altered data. Certain European and Japanese
institutions should probably also be discreetly consulted about the policies they would use to
reconstruct who owns what after a major data-altering breach. The Federal Reserve Bank and
the Securities Industry Automation Corporation, among other financial database operators, have
extensive off-site backup systems. Key to their being prepared to fix a data-altering breach is the
idea that there is data with a recent picture of â  who owns whatâ that is unlikely to be altered by a
cyber attack. With the agreement of the federal regulators, banks and stock markets could revert
to a prior date to recover from a data-altering breach. Some people would be hurt and others
enriched by such a decision and it would be the subject of litigation forever, but at least the
financial system could continue to operate.
Chinaâ s air traffic control (ATC) system was also placed on a withhold list in the exercise. As
the U.S. modernizes its ATC, making it more network dependent, the system is likely to become
only more vulnerable to cyber attack. Already with the older system, the U.S. has experienced
instances where individual airport towers and even specific regional centers have been blacked
out for hours because of computer or communications connectivity failures. As far as we know,
none of these major outages was caused by hacking. (There is one case of an arrest for hacking
into the FAA system, but the effects of the attack were minor.)
Nonetheless, the potential for someone altering data and causing aircraft to collide in midair
has to be considered. The U.S. is a party to the Montreal Convention, which makes an
intentional attack on a civilian airliner a violation of international law. Of course, almost all hacking
Page 98
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
is a violation of some national and/or international law, but the Montreal Convention is an
articulation of the general global sentiment that certain kinds of actions are beyond the pale of
acceptable conduct.
Hacking into the flight controls of an aircraft in flight is probably also becoming more feasible.
The Federal Aviation Agency raised concerns with Boeing that plans for the new 787 Dreamliner
called for the flight control system and the elaborate interactive passenger-entertainment system
to use the same computer network. The FAA was concerned that a passenger could hack into
the flight control system from his seat, or that live Internet connectivity for passengers could mean
that someone on the ground could hack into the system. The airlinesâ  own systems already create
a data connection from the ground to some aircraftâ s computer networks. The computer
networks on a large passenger aircraft are extensive and play a significant role in keeping the
aircraft in the air.
In modern â  fly-by-wireâ aircraft, it is the flight control system that sends a computer signal to a
flap, aileron, or rudder. The Air France crash over the South Atlantic in 2009, mentioned earlier,
revealed to a wider audience what pilots have known for years: in modern fly-by-wire aircraft,
onboard computers decide what signals to send to the control surfaces. Under certain
circumstances, the software can even override the decision of a pilot to prevent the manual
controls from making the aircraft do something that would cause it to stall or go out of control.
As that recent Air France crash also demonstrated, the aircraftâ s computers were firing off
messages back to the Air France headquartersâ  computers without the pilot being involved. As
with the ATC system, the computer networks of commercial passenger aircraft should probably
also be off limits. Military aircraft are, however, likely to be considered fair game.
Had the Cyber Command team asked the Controllers for permission to attack the reservations
and operations network of Chinese airlines, they may have gotten a different answer. In the real
world, computer crashes at U.S. and Canadian airlines have kept hundreds of aircraft grounded
for hours at a time. The aircraft worked and there were crews available, but without the
reservations database and the operational network up and running, the airlines did not know what
crew, passengers, cargo, or fuel load should go on what planes. The airlines, like so many other
huge business systems, no longer have manual backup systems that are sufficient to create even
minimal operations.
There may be other withholds, in addition to banking and commercial aircraft. In the exercise,
two of the networks that Cyber Command was told not to strike were Chinaâ s military command
and control network and their air defense system. Since those are purely military targets, why
were they spared?
6. ESCALATORY CONTROL
During the Cold War, I often participated in exercises in which teams of national security officials
were secretly hustled out of Washington on short notice to obscure, covert locations. Once at
our destinations, the teams did exactly what the War Games movie computer suggested. We
played thermonuclear war. These were massively depressing experiences, since the â  game
realityâ we had to accept was that millions of people had already died in a nuclear exchange. Our
job was almost always to finish the war and begin the recovery.
The most difficult part of finishing the war usually turned out to be finding who was still alive
and in control of the military on the other side. What survivor was in command of Soviet forces,
and how do we talk to him without either of us revealing our hidden locations? Part of the
problem that the game controllers deviously planned for us sometimes was that the guy with
whom we were negotiating war termination did not actually have control over some element of
the surviving Soviet force, for instance, their nuclear missile submarines. What we learned from
these unpleasant experiences was that if we eliminate the opponentâ s command and control
system, then he has no way to tell his forces to stop fighting. Isolated local commanders, cut off
from communications with higher echelons, or not recognizing the authority of the surviving
Page 99
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
successor, made their own decisions, and often it was to keep fighting. It was the nuclear war
equivalent of those lone Japanese fighters who kept turning up on remote Pacific isles in the
1950s, unaware that the Emperor had years before ordered them to surrender.
There may be a parallel in cyber war. If a cyber attack eliminates a military command and
control system, it could be difficult to prevent or terminate a kinetic war. In most militaries
authority devolves to the local commander if he cannot get in touch with his superiors. Even if the
command system is still operating, if the local commander believes that the system has been taken
over by an opponent who is now issuing false instructions, command probably devolves to the
local general until he can ascertain that he is in reliable communications with a valid superior. This
is the situation so vividly portrayed in the movie Crimson Tide, where the U.S. nuclear
submarine commander received and authenticated an order to launch nuclear missiles and then
received an order to stop. Unable to authenticate the order to stop the attack, and fearing that it
was a bogus order somehow sent by the Russians, the captain believes that procedures require
him to launch.
The conclusion that we came to repeatedly in the nuclear war games was that it was probably
an error to engage in a â  decapitating strike,â one that made it impossible for the leadership to
communicate with us or with their own forces. In cyber war, it may be desirable to cut off certain
units from higher command, or to deny an opposing force access to intelligence about what is
going on. But in choosing what units to cut off, one needs to keep in mind that severing the
command link to a unit runs the risk that it will launch an attack on its own. Thus, cyber attacks
should probably be carefully constructed so that there is still a surviving communications channel
for negotiations and a way in which the leadership can authoritatively order its forces to stop
fighting.
The exerciseâ s Control Team also denied Cyber Command the authority to strike at air
defense networks. The rationale for that kind of withhold at that point in hostilities is â  escalatory
control.â In his 1965 masterpiece of military strategy, On Escalation, Kahn argued that if your
goal is war termination short of the total destruction or forced surrender of the opponent, you can
signal that by what you strike and what you withhold. You may want to signal that you have
limited intentions so that the other side does not assume otherwise and proceed as if it has
nothing to lose.
There are cyber war corollaries to escalation control. A cyber attack on a nationâ s air defense
system would lead that countryâ s leadership to the logical conclusion that air attacks were about
to happen. In Exercise South China Sea, there were U.S. aircraft carriers nearby. If the Chinese
military thought that those carriers were getting ready for air strikes on China, they would be right
to take preemptive steps to sink the carriers. So, a cyber attack on the air defense network could
have caused the beginning of a kinetic war that we were seeking to avoid. Even an attempted
penetration of that network to lay in trapdoors and logic bombs might have been detected and
interpreted as a prelude to imminent bombing. So just getting into position to launch a cyber
attack would have sent the wrong message in a crisis, unless those steps had been taken well in
advance.
Herman Kahn, Thomas Schelling, William Kaufmann, and the other â  Wizards of
Armageddonâ spent a lot of time thinking about how to control nuclear escalation, from the
tensions leading up to a crisis, to signaling, to initial use, to war termination. Initially the nuclear
strategists saw war moving slowly up the escalatory ladder, with diplomatic attempts being made
at every rung to stop the conflict right there. They also discussed what I referred to earlier,
â  escalation dominance.â In that strategy, one side says, basically, â  We donâ t want to play around
with low-grade fighting that will gradually get bigger. If you want to fight me, itâ s going to be a
big, damaging fight.â Itâ s the warfare equivalent of going all-in on a hand in poker and hoping
your opponent will give up rather than risk all of his chips. Except that there is one big difference:
in escalation dominance you are actually jumping several rungs up the ladder and inflicting serious
damage on the other side. You accompany that move with the threat that you can and will do
Page 100
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
more significant damage unless it all stops right here, right now.
The fact that you have done that damage to them may cause the opponent to feel compelled to
respond in kind. Or, if you have a highly rational actor on the other side, theyâ ll understand that
the stakes are getting too high and they stand to suffer even more serious losses if things continue.
In Exercise South China Sea, the PLA decided to engage in escalation dominance. In response
to a cyber attack on the power grid in southeastern China, they not only hit the West Coast
power grid, they disrupted the global Defense Department intranet, damaged the databases of
U.S. financial clearinghouses, and sent additional kinetic warfare units into the crisis zone in the
South China Sea.
As the game continued, the U.S. leadership had to decide quickly whether it stood to lose
more than China in the next round of cyber war escalation. America would have been at a
disadvantage, because it stood to lose more in an ongoing, escalating cyber war. It therefore
sought a quick diplomatic settlement. Escalation dominance was the right move for China in this
game because that escalation showed that the U.S. was more susceptible to cyber attacks and
that further escalation would only make matters worse for the U.S. team. The U.S. could have
tried to block cyber traffic coming from China. But because the Chinese attacks were originating
inside the U.S., and there was not yet a deep-packet inspection system on the Internet
backbone, the next, larger, Chinese cyber attack would have been very difficult to stop.
Put more simply, if you are going to throw cyber rocks, you had better be sure that the house
you live in has less glass than the other guyâ s, or that yours has bulletproof windows.
7. POSITIVE CONTROL AND ACCIDENTAL WAR
The issue we discussed above, of maintaining some means for the opponent to exercise
command and control, raises a similar issue, namely: Who has the authority to penetrate
networks and to use cyber weapons? Earlier in this chapter I suggested that it may require the
approval of multiple Cabinet members to alter banking data, and yet we are not sure that the
President knows that the U.S. may have placed logic bombs in various nationsâ  power grids.
Those two facts suggest that there is too much ambiguity regarding who has what authority when
it comes to cyber war, including preparation of the battlefield.
In nuclear war strategy there were two central issues regarding who could do what, and they
came under the general heading of â  positive control.â The first was, simply: Could some U.S.
military officer who had a nuclear weapon use that weapon even if he was not authorized to do
so? To prevent that from happening, as well as to prevent someone from stealing and then setting
off a bomb, elaborate electronics were embedded in the bombâ s design. The electronics
physically blocked the bomb from detonating unless the lock had received an alphanumeric
unlocking code. On many weapons, two officers had to each confirm the code and
simultaneously turn physical keys to accomplish their part of the unlocking sequence. This was
called the â  two keyâ control. Part of that code was kept away from the weapon and would be
sent down by higher authority to those who would unlock it. These â  permissive action links,â or
PALs, grew more sophisticated over the years. The U.S. shared parts of its PAL technology
with some other nuclear-weapon states.
The second issue regarding positive control was: Who should be the higher authority capable
of sending down the unlocking codes for nuclear weapons? The theory was that under normal
circumstances that authority would rest with the President. A military officer attached to the U.S.
President carries at all times a locked case in which reside the â  go codesâ for various nuclear
attack options. I learned during the attempted military coup in Moscow in 1990 that the Soviets
had a similar system. President Gorbachev, who was taken hostage at one point in the crisis, had
the nuclear â  go codesâ with him at his vacation villa. The Gorbachev incident highlights the need
for having the decision-making authority devolve if the President is unable to act. The U.S.
government refuses to acknowledge who below the President has the authority to unlock and use
nuclear weapons and under what circumstances that power devolves. All personnel who have
Page 101
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
physical access to nuclear weapons must undergo special security review and testing as part of a
personnel reliability system designed to weed out persons with psychological or emotional issues.
Cyber weapons would have a far lesser impact than nuclear weapons, but their employment
under certain circumstances could be highly damaging and could also trigger broader war. So,
who gets to decide to use them, and how do we make sure they are not used without
authorization? Who should decide what networks we should be penetrating as part of the
preparation of the battlefield?
Until we gain more experience with cyber weapons, I would argue that the President should at
least annually approve broad guidelines about what kinds of networks in what countries we
should be penetrating for both intelligence collection and for the embedding of logic bombs.
Some will criticize that as overly restrictive, noting that we have been penetrating networks for
intelligence collection for years without presidential review. That may be true, but in many cases
there are only a few keystrokesâ  difference between penetrating a network to collect intelligence
and hacking your way in to cause destruction and disruption. Because there is the risk, however
low, that logic bombs and other penetrations may be discovered and misunderstood as hostile
intentions, the President should decide on how much risk he wants to take, and with whom.
The decision to use a cyber weapon for disruptive or destructive purposes should also rest
with the President, or, in rare cases where quick action is necessary, with the Secretary of
Defense. There may be circumstances in which regional commanders should have some
predelegated authority to respond defensively to an ongoing or imminent attack. However, Cyber
Command and its subordinate units should employ some form of software control analogous to
the two-key control on nuclear weapons to ensure that an overzealous or massively bored young
lieutenant cannot initiate an attack.
Even with proper command controls in effect, there is the potential for accidental war. In the
Cold War, early radar systems could sometimes not distinguish between huge flocks of Canada
geese and formations of Russian bombers. Thus, there were times when the U.S. launched the
portion of its bombers that were kept on strip alert and sent them heading toward their
destinations until air defense authorities could clarify the situation and determine for sure if we
were under attack.
In cyber war, it is possible to imagine accidental attacks developing if somehow the wrong
application were used and instead of inserting code that copied data, we mistakenly used code
that deleted data. Alternatively, you could imagine the possibility that a logic bomb might be
accidentally triggered by the network operator or by some other hacker who found it. The
chances of that happening are very low, but Cyber Command and others engaged in hacking into
other nationsâ  networks must have strict procedures to ensure that no such mistake occurs. The
greatest potential for accidental cyber war is likely to come in the form of retaliating against the
wrong nation because we were misled as to who attacked us.
8. ATTRIBUTION
In Exercise South China Sea, neither side doubted the identity of who was attacking them. There
was a political context, rising tensions over the offshore oil fields. But what if, instead of China
having done the attack, it was Vietnam? In the exercise scenario, Vietnam and the U.S. are allied
against China. So why would our ally attack us? Perhaps Vietnam wants to drag the U.S. deeper
into the conflict, to get Washington to stand up against China. What better way than letting
Washington think that China was engaged in cyber war against us? And when China denied that
it was them, we would probably just write that off as Beijing engaging in plausible deniability. (If
you want to contemplate a similar scenario, and if you will forgive a bit of shameless
self-promotion, read my novel Breakpoint, which deals with cyber war attribution, among other
things.)
The cyber experts at Black Hat were asked at the 2009 meeting whether they thought the
problem of attribution was as important as some suggest, that is, is it really that hard to figure out
Page 102
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
who is attacking you, and does knowing who attacked you really matter? To a person, they
answered that attribution was not a major issue to them. It was not that they thought it was easy
to identify the attacker; rather, they just did not care who it was. These were mainly corporate
people whose networks had been attacked and when it had happened, their chief concern was
getting the system back to normal and preventing that kind of attack from happening again. Their
experiences dealing with the FBI had convinced most of them that it was hardly worth it even to
report to law enforcement when they had been attacked.
For national security officials, however, knowing who attacked you is much more important.
The President may ask. You may want to send the attacker a diplomatic note of protest, a
demarche (what we called in the State Department a â  dÃ©marche-mallow.â), as Secretary Clinton
did after news of the attempted hacking on Google from Mainland China went public. You might
even want to retaliate to get them to stop doing it. One way to find out who the attacker was is to
use trace-back software, but eventually you will probably get to a server that does not
cooperate. You could, at that point, file a diplomatic note requesting that the law enforcement
authorities in the country get a warrant, go around to the server, and pull its records as part of
international cooperation in investigating a crime. That could take days, and the records might be
destroyed by then. Or the country in question may not want to help you. When trace-back stops
working, you do have the option of â  hack back,â breaking into the server and checking its
records. Of course, that is illegal for U.S. citizens to do, unless they are U.S. intelligence officers.
Hacking into a server to trace the origin of an attack may not work, either, if the attacker
worked hard at covering up his origins. You may have to be online, watching live when the attack
packets actually move through the servers. It is unlikely that you will find that, say, even after
bouncing through a dozen servers in as many countries to cover their tracks, the attacking
packets had originated in some place called the â  Russian Offensive Cyber War Agency.â Just to
be safe, if it were the Russian government, they probably would have directed the attack from a
server in another country and, if it were an intelligence-collection operation, the data they copied
would probably have been sent to a data-storage unit in a third country.
So when it comes to figuring out who attacked you, unless you are sitting on the network the
attacker uses and you see it coming (and sometimes not even then), you may not know right
away. Computer forensics may be able to say that the original keyboard used in developing the
attack code was designed for Arabic, or Cyrillic, or Korean, but that is hardly dispositive as to
the identity of the hacker. And if you do find that the attack came from Russia, based on what
happened to Estonia and Georgia, the authorities there will likely blame citizen hacktivists and do
nothing to them.
This attribution difficulty could mean that nations trying to identify their attackers may need to
rely upon more traditional intelligence techniques, such as spies penetrating the other sideâ s
organization, or police methods. Human intelligence, unlike cyber, does not move at velocities
approaching the speed of light. Quick responses may not be available. In nuclear war strategy,
attribution was not generally thought to be a major problem because we could tell where a missile
or bomber had been launched. Cyber attack may be similar to a suitcase bomb going off in an
American city. If we see the attack being launched because we are watching the cyber equivalent
of their missile silos and bomber bases, we might be able to assign attack attribution with a high
degree of certainty. But if the attack starts on servers in the U.S., it may take a while to tell the
President that we really know who attacked us. How sure do you need to be before you
respond? The answer will likely depend upon the real-world circumstances at the time.
9. CRISIS INSTABILITY
The late Bill Kaufmann once asked me to write a paper on something called â  launch on warning.â
The Strategic Air Command had the idea that as soon as we saw a Soviet nuclear attack coming
we should launch as many bombers as we could and fire our land-based missiles. As the Soviets
had improved the accuracy of their missiles, it had become possible for them to destroy our
Page 103
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
missiles even though we kept them in hardened, underground silos. As with everything in strategic
nuclear doctrine, even this idea of â  fire when you see them comingâ got complicated. What if you
were wrong, if your sensors made a mistake? Perhaps they were attacking, but with a small force
aimed at only a few things, should you still throw the kitchen sink at them? Therefore the Air
Force had evolved a strategy called â  launch under attack,â which essentially meant that you
waited until you had a better picture, until some of their missilesâ  warheads were already going off
in your countryside.
The launch on warning strategy was generally thought to be risky because it added to crisis
instability, the hair-trigger phenomenon in a period of rising tensions. If you donâ t make the right
decision quickly, you lose, but if you have to make the decision quickly, you may make a losing
decision. What I was able to conclude for Kaufmann was that we had enough missiles at sea,
and those missiles had grown sufficiently accurate, that we could ride out an attack and then
make a rational decision about what had just happened before we sized our response.
There is a similar issue with cyber war. The U.S. expects to see an attack coming and move
quickly to blunt the cyber assault and destroy the attackerâ s ability to try it again. The assumption
about being able to see an attack coming may be invalid. Nonetheless, we will assume that the
U.S. strategy is to see the attack coming and act. To act, you have to go quickly and without a
lot of assessment of who the enemy was or what they were going to strike. If you do not go
quickly, however, you suffer two possible disadvantages:
ï· The attacking nation will probably pull up the drawbridge over the
moat after its attackers charge out of the castle, by which we mean that
as soon as they launch a big attack, a nation like China may disconnect
from the rest of the Internet and â  islandâ subnets;
ï· The attacking nation may be going after the Internet itself and the
telephone infrastructure in the United States, which might make it
harder for the U.S. to launch a cyber retaliation.
Thus, there could be a real case of first mover advantage, and that leads to crisis
instability, a hair trigger, no time to think. Now, remember the earlier discussion about 
ambiguity of intent, what one side indicates by the types of targets it goes after in the
preparation-of-the-battlefield period. If a nation believes that the other side has already
laced its infrastructure (including cyber and electrical networks) with destructive software
packages or logic bombs, that consideration, combined with the first mover advantage,
could cause a decision maker in a time of rising tensions to have a very itchy keyboard
finger.
10. DEFENSIVE ASYMMETRY
The team playing China won this exercise, forcing a withdrawal of U.S. forces and
causing the United States to negotiate a face-saving way out. The chief reason they won
was that they had been able to overcome U.S. defenses and to erect relatively effective
defenses of their own. The U.S. was looking for an attack to originate overseas, and
China used servers in the U.S., perhaps directed by Chinese â  studentsâ operating out of
coffee shops. The U.S. was looking for the signatures of attacks that it already knew
about and the Chinese used â  zero dayâ exploits. Most important, the U.S. had no
national defense mechanism for the civilian infrastructure, including the finance industry,
the electric power grid, and rail systems.
China, on the other had, not only had a national command system that could dictate to
its infrastructure, they had a defensive plan. When it was clear that cyber war was under
way, Chinaâ s electric and rail systems shifted to a non-networked control system. When
the Chinese lost satellite communications, they had a backup radio network up in an
hour. In short, China had not thrown out their old systems, and had a plan to use them.

The lessons learned in the â  hot washâ of this exercise have helped to identify issues and
choices, which will lead us toward a cyber war strategy. There is, however, one further
missing ingredient. We have talked a little about the international laws of war and other
conventions. What international laws cover cyber war, and what additional multilateral
agreements would be in our interest, if any?

CHAPTER SEVEN
CYBER PEACE
The United States, almost single-handedly, is blocking arms control in cyberspace. Russia, somewhat
ironically, is the leading advocate. Given the potential destabilizing nature and disadvantages of cyber war
to the U.S., as discussed in the earlier chapters, one might think that by now the United States would
have begun negotiating international arms control agreements that could limit the risks. In fact, since the
Clinton Administration first rejected a Russian proposal, the U.S. has been a consistent opponent of
cyber arms control.
Or, to be completely frank, perhaps I should admit that I rejected the Russian proposal. There were
many who joined me; few U.S. government decisions are ever the responsibility of a single person.
However, one of my jobs in the Clinton White House was to coordinate cyber security policy, including
international agreements, across the government. Despite some interest in the State Department in
pursuing cyber arms control, and although the U.S. had to stand almost alone in the U.N. in rejecting
cyber talks, we said no. I viewed the Russian proposal as largely a propaganda tool, as so many of their
multilateral arms control initiatives had been for decades. Verification of any cyber agreement seemed
impossible. Moreover, the U.S. had not yet explored what it wanted to do in the area of cyber war. It
was not obvious then whether or not cyber war added to or subtracted from U.S. national security. So
we said no, and we have kept saying no for over a decade now.
Now that over twenty nationsâ  militaries and intelligence services have created offensive cyber war
units and we have gained a better understanding of what cyber war could look like, it may be time for the
United States to review its position on cyber arms control and ask whether there is anything beneficial
that could be achieved through an international agreement.
A SHORT CRITIQUE OF ARMS CONTROL
Whether or not you think reviewing our position on cyber arms limitations is a good policy may well
depend upon what you think about arms control more broadly. So letâ s begin by recalling what arms
control is (since it no longer dominates the news) and what it has done in other areas. Although there
were international arms control agreements before the nuclear era, such as the Washington Treaty that
limited the number of battleships navies could have before World War II, arms control as we now know
it was shaped by the Cold War standoff between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. Beginning in the early 1960s
and continuing for almost thirty years, arms control became a major preoccupation of the two nuclear
superpowers. What resulted were two classes of agreements: multilateral treaties, in which the two
superpowers invited global participation, and bilateral agreements, in which they agreed to impose
specific limitations on their own military capabilities.
I began working on arms control in Vienna in 1974 and, at the Pentagon and then the State
Department, was involved for almost twenty years in agreements on strategic nuclear weapons,
conventional forces in Europe, so-called theater nuclear weapons of shorter range, biological weapons,
and chemical weapons. That experience shapes the way I think about cyber arms control. There are
lessons the United States can learn from this history as we seek to limit warfare in cyberspace through a
new round of treaties.
My colleague Charles Duelfer, who was one of the leaders of UN efforts to limit Iraqi weapons of
mass destruction for over a decade, takes a cynical view of U.S.-Soviet arms control and of the
phenomenon in general. â  The U.S. and U.S.S.R. generally agreed to ban things they were not going to
do anyway. On weapons they did want, they agreed to numeric ceilings that were so high that they got to
do everything they wanted.â Many analysts, like Duelfer, have a negative critique of arms control in
general. They note that the fifteen-year-long talks on forces in Central Europe finally produced an accord
with high limits on military personnel only months before the Soviet Unionâ s military alliance crumbled
anyway. The final treaty allowed the Soviet Union to keep hundreds of thousands of troops in Eastern
Europe, but reality did not. What caused the thousands of Red Army tanks to clank back into Russia
was not arms control.
Page 106
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
The more well known series of negotiations of the SALT and START agreements on strategic nuclear
forces lasted over twenty years and permitted both sides to maintain enormous numbers of nuclear
weapons and to continue to replace them with more modern versions. As part of that process, in the
ABM Treaty, the two nations banned antiballistic missile defenses, which at the time neither side thought
would work anyway.
In the multilateral arena, the two superpowers agreed on a treaty to prohibit other nations from
acquiring nuclear weapons in exchange for a vague promise that the nuclear powers would eventually
eliminate their own. That treaty did not stop Israel, Pakistan, India, South Africa, or North Korea from
developing nuclear weapons and is now doing little to stop Iran. The Soviet Union agreed to a multilateral
ban on biological weapons, but then secretly went on to create a massive biological weapons arsenal that
the United States did not detect for decades. The critics of arms control point to the Soviet violation of
the Biological Weapons Treaty as an example of why arms control is often not in the U.S. interest. The
U.S. is fairly scrupulous in its obedience of treaty limits to which it agrees. Many other nations are not.
Verification measures may not detect violations, or permitted activities may allow nations to come right
up to the point of a violation without being sanctioned (as Iran may be doing with its nuclear reprocessing
program).
For all the problems with arms control, there is a compelling case that both the bilateral agreements
between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. and the broader multilateral treaties made the world safer. Even putting
aside the value of the numeric limits on weapons, the very existence of a forum where the American and
Soviet diplomats and military leaders could talk to each other about nuclear war helped to create a
consensus among the elites of both countries to take measures to prevent such a disaster. The
introduction of communications channels and confidence-building measures, the increase in transparency
of both sidesâ  armed forces reduced the possibility of miscalculation or accidental war.
As Assistant Secretary of State, it was my duty to supervise one of those so-called
confidence-building measures, the U.S. Nuclear Risk Reduction Center. My counterpart was a Russian
General in the Ministry of Defense. Our two teams worked on measures to reduce the likelihood of
tensions escalating into nuclear alerts. Each team had a center, mine in the State Department and the
generalâ s in the Ministry of Defense, just off Red Square in Moscow. Because the White Houseâ Kremlin
hotline was seldom employed by U.S. Presidents, we needed a way of communicating quickly at a lower
level when there may have been a misunderstanding. So we connected the two centers by direct cable
and satellite links, by Teletype for text, and by secure telephones. The secure telephone had to use an
encryption code that we and the Soviets could share, which posed a problem for both countries. We
both wanted to use encryption that would provide no clue about codes either side used elsewhere. Such
was the fear of electronic espionage that some people thought that with such connectivity, I was just
providing a way for the Soviets to listen in on U.S. communications. The entire U.S. Center, just off the
State Department Operations area, had to be lined in copper and acoustic dampening materials.
The Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers were designed to prevent the kind of mistaken escalation that
occurred in the early days of the Cold War. One day when a U.S. space launch from an aircraft platform
aborted, we realized that on Russian radar the descending missile could look like a single
depressed-trajectory surprise attack, possibly aimed at decapitating the leadership by hitting Moscow. I
quickly called my counterpart in the Defense Ministry, on the secure line. Those lines were used
repeatedly in instances like that, as well as to coordinate implementation of arms control agreements.
While it is true that SALT and START permitted large arsenals to continue for a long time, the treaties
did ban destabilizing activities and programs that both sides might otherwise have felt the need to test or
deploy. The numeric limits also provided a known quantity to the other sideâ s force, preventing an even
greater upward arms spiral based on false assumptions about what the other was intending. Eventually,
thanks to the persistence of National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, the two sides banned the highly
destabilizing multiple-warhead land-based missiles. Now, the U.S. and Russia are making meaningful
reductions in their strategic forces.
The Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, on which I worked for several years in the early
1980s, caused the United States to destroy its Pershing II mobile ballistic system and its ground-launched
Page 107
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
cruise missiles, or GLCMs (they were originally called land-launched cruise missiles, or LLCMs, until the
way that acronym was pronouncedâ lickemsâ occasioned so many off-color jokes that the Pentagon
changed it), in exchange for the destruction of hundreds of Soviet SS-4, SS-5, and SS-20 mobile nuclear
missiles. That entire class of weapon, which could be used to circumvent limits on longer-range systems,
was permanently banned and several thousand nuclear warheads in Europe were taken out of service.
The limits on nuclear weapons testing did begin with the modest prohibition of detonating weapons in
the atmosphere, but over time evolved into a limit on the size of all nuclear tests and eventually to a ban
on nuclear testing altogether. (The complete ban on testing has not yet been ratified by the U.S. Senate.)
The ban on chemical weapons, which I worked on in the early 1990s, is causing nations to destroy their
chemical weapons, prohibits making new ones, and has a very intrusive inspection regime for verification.
(While we did not agree to â  anytime, anywhereâ inspection, few areas are exempt.)
Beyond the limits and bans on nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, arms control includes limits
on the conduct of war itself. A series of agreements on armed conflict bans attacks on military hospitals,
prohibits attacks on civilian population centers, establishes standards for treating prisoners of war, bans
torture, outlaws land mines, limits the use of child soldiers, and makes genocide an international crime.
The United States has not ratified all of these agreements (such as the ban on land mines) and has
recently violated others (such as the Convention Against Torture). World War II saw broad violations of
the laws of armed conflict, but even then some nations upheld the standards for treatment of prisoners of
war.
When arms control works well, it reduces uncertainty, creating a more predictable security
environment. By establishing some practices as illegal and some armament acquisition as a violation, arms
control agreements can clarify what another nationâ s intentions might be. If a nation is willing to violate a
clear agreement, there is less ambiguity about their policies. By prohibiting certain arms and practices,
arms control can sometimes help nations to avoid expenditures that they might have been driven to only
by fear that other nations were about to do the same. Agreed-upon international norms can be useful in
gathering multilateral support against a nation that is an outlier.
When arms control is not valuable and can even be unhelpful is when it is largely hortatory, or when
the negotiation is seen as an end in itself or a platform for propaganda, when its limitations are vague and
also when violations are without cost to the violator. If a nation can quickly move from compliance to
significant violation with little or no warning time, the attributes of stability and predictability are lost.
Similarly, if nations can cheat on agreements with little or no risk of detection or fear of punishment when
caught, the agreements tend to be one-sided and are discredited.
My overall view is that the arms control experience we had in the last thirty years of the Cold War was
largely positive, but it was very far from a panacea and occasionally it was little more than a farce. A
simple test of whether an area is ripe for arms control is to determine if all parties have a real interest in
limiting their own investments in the area. If a party is proposing to stop something that they really want to
keep around, then they are likely merely engaged in arms control for propaganda or as a deceptive
means of constraining a potential opponent in an area where they think they may be outclassed.
LIMIT CYBER WAR?
All of which brings us back to cyber war. To determine our national policy toward concepts of arms
control or limits on cyber war activities, we first need to ask whether this new form of combat gives the
United States such an advantage over other nations that we would not wish to see international
constraints. If we believe that we do enjoy such a unilateral advantage, and that it is likely to continue,
then we should not ask the follow-on questions about what kinds of limits might be created, whether they
could be verified, and so on.
I suggested earlier that at present the U.S. would be better off if cyber warfare never existed, given
our asymmetrical vulnerabilities to such warfare. Before looking at cyber war control, letâ s first consider
four ways in which we are more vulnerable than those nations that might use cyber weapons against us.
First, at the moment, the United States has a greater dependency upon cyber-controlled systems than
potential adversary nations. Other nations such as South Korea or Estonia may have greater consumer
Page 108
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
access to broadband. Others such as the United Arab Emirates may have more Internet-capable mobile
devices per capita. But few nations have used computer networks as extensively to control electric
power, pipelines, airlines, railroads, distribution of consumer goods, banking, and contractor support of
the military.
Second, few nations, and certainly none of our potential adversaries, have more of their essential
national systems owned and operated by private enterprise companies. Third, in no other major
industrialized and technologically developed nation are those private owners and operators of
infrastructure so politically powerful that they can routinely prevent or dilute government regulation of
their operations. The American political system of well-financed lobbying and largely unconstrained
political campaign contributions has greatly empowered private industry groups, especially when it comes
to avoiding meaningful federal regulation.
Fourth, the U.S. military is highly vulnerable to cyber attack. The U.S. military is â  netcentric,â bringing
access to databases and information further down into the operation of every imaginable type of military
organization. Along with that access to information systems has come dependence upon them. One small
sign of things to come was reported in late 2009. Insurgents in Iraq had used twenty-six-dollar software
to monitor the video feeds of U.S. Predator drones through an unencrypted communications link. While
not directly threatening to American troops, the discovery raises questions about the Pentagonâ s beloved
new weapon. What if the unencrypted signal could be jammed, thus causing the drone to return home?
American forces would be denied one of their most valuable tools and an off-the-shelf program would
defeat the product of millions of dollars of research and development. U.S. forces, in addition to being
more wired, are also more dependent upon private-sector contractor support than any likely adversary.
Even if the U.S. militaryâ s own networks were secure and reliable, those of its contractors, who often
rely upon the public Internet, may not be.
Those four asymmetries, taken together, tell us that if we and a potential adversary engaged in
unlimited cyber warfare, they might do more damage to us than we could do to them. Having some
effective limits on what nations actually do with their cyber war knowledge might, given our asymmetrical
vulnerabilities, be in the U.S. national interest. Putting that broad theory into practice, however, would
require some precise definitions of what kinds of activity might be permitted and what kinds prohibited.
Often arms control negotiations have found difficulty in achieving agreement on something as basic as a
definition of what it is that they were seeking to limit. I sat around the table for months with Soviet
counterparts trying to define something as simple as â  military personnel.â For the purposes of discussion
in this book, we wonâ t have that kind of delay. Letâ s take the definition we used in chapter 1 and make it
sound more like treaty language:
Cyber warfare is the unauthorized penetration by, on behalf of, or in support of, a government into
another nationâ s computer or network, or any other activity affecting a computer system, in which the
purpose is to add, alter, or falsify data, or cause the disruption of or damage to a computer, or
network device, or the objects a computer system controls.
With that definition and the U.S. asymmetrical vulnerabilities in mind, are there successes in other
forms of arms control that could be ported into cyberspace, or new ideas unique to the characteristics of
cyber war that could form the basis of beneficial arms control? What are the pitfalls of bad arms control
to which we should give special attention and caution when thinking about limits on cyber war? How
could an international agreement limiting some aspects of cyber war be beneficial to the United States, as
well as operationally feasible and adequately verifiable?
SCOPE: ESPIONAGE OR WAR?
Any potential international agreement limiting or controlling cyber war must begin with the scope of the
proposal. In other words: What is covered and what is out? The definition of cyber war I used above
does not include cyber espionage. Hacking your way in to spy, to collect information, does not add or
alter data, nor does it need to damage or disrupt the network or things that the network controls in
physical space, if itâ s done well.
The Russian cyber arms control proposal, however, is sweeping in its scope and would prohibit
Page 109
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
something that the Russian Federation is doing every day, spying through hacking. The chief public
advocate of the Russian proposal, Vladislav Sherstyuk, had a career of managing hackers. As Director
of FAPSI, General Sherstyuk was the direct counterpart to the U.S. Director of the National Security
Agency. His career background does not necessarily mean that General Sherstyuk is now being
disingenuous when he advocates an international regime to prohibit what he has directed his agency to do
for years. The technical differences between cyber espionage and destructive cyber war are so narrow,
perhaps General Sherstyuk thinks that a distinction between the two cannot effectively be made. Or
perhaps he has had a change of heart. Perhaps he believes that cyber espionage is something that now
puts Russia at a disadvantage. More likely, however, the general, like all who have seen cyber espionage
in action, would be very reluctant to give it up.
Cyber espionage is, at one level, vastly easier than traditional espionage. It is hard to exaggerate the
difficulty of recruiting a reliable spy and getting such an agent into the right place in an organization so that
he or she can copy and exfiltrate a meaningful amount of valuable information. Then there is always the
suspicion that the material being provided is falsified and that the spy is a double agent. The best
counterintelligence procedure has always been to imagine where the opponent would want to have a spy
and then give them one there. The agent passes on low-grade data and then adds some slightly falsified
material that makes it useless, or worse.
As I discussed in Your Government Failed You, the U.S. is not particularly good at using spies or, as
the Americans like to call it, human intelligence (often shortened to HUMINT). The reasons have to do
with the difficulty of the task, our reluctance to trust some kinds of people who might make good spies,
the reticence of many Americans to become deep-cover agents, and the ability of other nations to detect
our attempts at spying. These conditions are deeply seated and cultural, have been true for sixty years or
more, and are unlikely to change.
What we are remarkably good at is electronic spying. In fact, our abilities in cyber espionage often
make up for our inabilities in the area of HUMINT. Thus, one could argue that forcing the U.S. to give
up cyber espionage would significantly reduce our intelligence-collection capability, and that such a ban
would possibly put us at a greater disadvantage than it would some other nations.
The idea of limiting cyber espionage requires us to question what is wrong with doing it, to ask what
problem is such a ban intended to solve. Although Henry Stimson, Secretary of State under President
Herbert Hoover, did stop some espionage on the grounds that â  gentlemen do not read each otherâ s
mail,â most U.S. Presidents have found intelligence gathering essential to their conduct of national
security. Knowledge is power. Espionage is about getting knowledge. Nations have been engaging in
espionage at least since biblical times. Knowing what another nationâ s capabilities are and having a view
into what they are doing behind closed doors usually contributes to stability. Wild claims about an
opponent can lead to tensions and arms races. Spying can sometimes calm such fears, as when in 1960
there was discussion of a â  missile gap,â that is, that the Sovietsâ  missile inventory greatly exceeded our
own. Our early spy satellites ended that concern. Espionage can also sometimes prevent surprises and
the need to be ready, on a hair trigger, in constant expectation of certain kinds of surprises. Yet there are
some fundamental differences between cyber espionage and traditional spying that we may want to
consider.
During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union each spent billions spying on each other.
We worked hard, as did the Soviets, to recruit spies within sensitive ministries in order to learn about
intentions, capabilities, and weaknesses. Sometimes we succeeded and reaped huge benefits. More often
than not, we failed. Those failures sometimes came with damaging consequences.
In the late 1960s, U.S. espionage efforts against North Korea almost led to combat twice. The U.S.
Navy electronic espionage ship Pueblo was seized, along with its eighty-two crew members, by the
North Korean Navy in January 1968. For eleven months, until the crew was released, militaries on the
Korean Peninsula were on high alert, fearing a shooting war. Five months after the crewâ s release, a U.S.
Air Force EC-121 electronic espionage aircraft was shot down off the North Korean coast, killing all
thirty-one Americans on board (interestingly, on the birthday of North Korean leader Kim Il-sung). The
U.S. President, Richard Nixon, considered bombing in response, but with the U.S. Army tied down in
Page 110
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Vietnam, he held his fire, lest the incident escalate into a second U.S. war in Asia.
Seven months later, a U.S. Navy submarine was allegedly operating inside the territorial waters of the
Soviet Union when the ship collided underwater with a Red Navy submarine. Six years later Seymour
Hersh reported, â  The American submarine, the USS Gato, was on a highly classified reconnaissance
mission as part of what the Navy called the Holystone program when she and the Soviet submarine
collided fifteen to twenty-five miles off the entrance to the White Sea.â According to Peter Sasgenâ s
excellent Stalking the Bear, â  Operation Holystone was a series of missions carried out during the Cold
War [that] encompassed everything from recording the acoustic signatures of individual Soviet
submarines to collecting electronic communications to videotaping weapon tests.â Both these incidents of
spying gone wrong could have brought us into very real and dangerous conflict.
In early 1992, I was an Assistant Secretary of State, and my boss, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, was engaged in delicate negotiations with Russia about arms control and the end of the Cold War.
Baker believed he was succeeding in overcoming the feelings of defeat and paranoia in the leadership
circles and the military elites in Moscow. He sought to assuage fears that we would take advantage of the
collapse of the Soviet Union. Then, on February 11, the USS Baton Rouge, a nuclear submarine,
collided not far off the coast from Severomorsk with the Red Banner Fleetâ s Kostroma, a Sierra-class
submarine. The Russians, outraged, charged that the U.S. submarine had been collecting intelligence
inside the legal limit of their territory.
I recall how furious Baker was as he demanded to know who in the State Department had approved
the Baton Rougeâ s mission and what possible value it could have compared to the damage that could be
done by its discovery. Baker urgently embarked on a diplomatic repair mission, promising his
embarrassed counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, that any future such U.S. operations would be
canceled. The USS Baton Rouge, badly damaged, made it back to port, where it was, shortly after,
struck from the fleet and decommissioned. Those in Moscow who had been preaching that America was
hoodwinking them had their proof. The distrust Baker sought to end only grew instead.
As we think of cyber espionage, we should not just think of it as a new intercept method. Cyber
espionage is in many ways easier, cheaper, more successful, and has fewer consequences than traditional
espionage. That may mean that more countries will spy on each other, and do more of it than they
otherwise would.
Prior to cyber espionage, there were physical limits to how much information a spy could steal and,
thus, in some areas there were partial constraints on the extent of the damage he could do. The case of
the F-35 fighter (mentioned briefly above, in chapter 5) demonstrates how when the quantitative aspect
of espionage changes so much with the introduction of the cyber dimension, it does not just add a new
technique. Rather, the speed, volume, and global reach of cyber activities make cyber espionage
fundamentally and qualitatively different from what has gone before. Letâ s look at the F-35 incident again
to see why.
The F-35 is a fifth-generation fighter plane being developed by Lockheed Martin. The F-35 is meant
to meet the needs of the Navy, Air Force, and Marines in the twenty-first century for an air-to-ground
striker, replacing the aging fleet of F-16s and F-18s. The F-35â s biggest advancement over the
fourth-generation aircraft will be in its electronic warfare and smart weapons capabilities. With a smaller
payload than its predecessors, the F-35 was designed around a â  one shot, one killâ mode of warfare that
depends on advanced targeting systems. Between the Air Force, Navy, and Marines, the U.S. military
has ordered nearly 2,500 of these planes, at a cost of over $300 billion. NATO nations have also
ordered the aircraft. The F-35 would provide dominance over any potential adversary for the next three
decades. That dominance could be challenged if our enemies could find a way to hack it.
In April 2009, someone broke into data storage systems and downloaded terabytesâ  worth of
information related to the development of the F-35. The information they stole was related to the design
of the aircraft and to its electronics systems, although what exactly was stolen may never be known
because the hackers covered their tracks by encrypting the stolen information before exporting it.
According to Pentagon officials, the most sensitive information on the program could not have been
accessed because it was allegedly air-gapped from the network. With a high degree of certainty, these
Page 111

officials believe that the intrusion can be traced back to an IP address in China and that the signature of
the attack implicates Chinese government involvement. This was not the first time the F-35 program had
been successfully hacked. The theft of the F-35 data started in 2007 and continued through 2009. The
reported theft was â  severalâ terabytes of information. For simplicityâ s sake, letâ s assume it was just one
terabyte. So, how much did they steal? The equivalent of ten copies of the Encyclopaedia Britannica,
all 32 volumes and 44 million words, ten times over.
If a Cold War spy wanted to move that much information out of a secret, classified facility, he would
have needed a small moving van and a forklift. He also would have risked getting caught or killed. Robert
Hanssen, the FBI employee who spied for the Soviets, and then the Russians, starting in the 1980s, never
revealed anywhere near that much material in over two decades. He secreted documents out of FBI
headquarters, wrapped them in plastic bags, and left them in dead drops in parks near his home in
Virginia. In all, Hanssenâ s betrayal amounted to no more than a few hundred pages of documents.
Hanssen now spends twenty-three hours a day in solitary confinement in his cell at the supermax
prison in Colorado Springs. He is allowed no letters, no visitors, no phone calls, and when addressed by
prison guards, is referred to only as â  the prisonerâ in the third person (â  the prisoner will exit his cellâ). At
least Hanssen escaped with his life. The spies he betrayed were not so lucky. At least three Russians in
the employ of the American intelligence community were betrayed by Hanssen and killed by the
Russians. A fourth was sent to prison. Spying used to be a dangerous business for the spies. Today it is
done remotely.
The spies who stole the information on the F-35 didnâ t need to wait for a recruit to be promoted to
gain access, they didnâ t have to find someone motivated to betray his country, and no one had to risk
getting caught and going to a supermax, or worse. Yet with the information stolen, they may be able to
find a weakness in the design or in the systems of the F-35. Perhaps they will be able to see a
vulnerability to a new kind of cyber weapon they will use in a future war to eliminate our dominance in the
air by dominating cyberspace. That may not even be the worst-case scenario. What if, while the hackers
were in our systems, exfiltrating information, they also uploaded a software package? Maybe it was
designed to provide a trapdoor for access to the network later, once their original way in was patched.
Maybe it was a logic bomb set to take down the Pentagonâ s network in a future crisis. Moving from
espionage to sabotage is just a few clicks of the mouse. Whoever â  theyâ are, they may be in our systems
now just to collect information, but that access could allow them to damage or destroy our networks. So,
knowing that nations have been in our systems â  just to spyâ may give the Pentagon and the President a
moment of pause in the next crisis.
Banning cyber espionage effectively would present huge challenges. Detecting whether a nation is
engaging in cyber espionage may be close to impossible. The ways in which the U.S. and Russia now
engage in cyber espionage are usually undetectable. Even if we had means of noticing the most
sophisticated forms of network penetration, it could be exceedingly difficult to prove who was on the
keyboard at the other end of the fiber, or for whom he was working. If we agreed to a treaty that
stopped cyber espionage, U.S. agencies would presumably cease such activity, but it is extremely
doubtful that some other nations would.
The ways in which we collect information, including by cyber espionage, may offend some peopleâ s
sensibilities and may sometimes violate international or national laws, but, with some notable exceptions,
U.S. espionage activities are generally necessary and beneficial to U.S. interests. Moreover, the
perception that espionage is vital is widespread among U.S. national security experts and legislators. One
question I always asked my teams when I was engaged in arms control was, â  When it comes time to
testify in favor of the ratification of this agreement, how will you explain to the U.S. Senate how you came
to agree to this provision, or, since it will likely be me testifying, how the hell do I explain why we agreed
to this?â With an agreement to limit espionage, I would not even know where to begin. And so, when
looking at a Russian proposal to ban cyber espionage, one is left wondering why they proposed it and
what it says about the overall intent and purpose of their advocacy of a cyber war treaty. The Russian
proposal to ban cyber espionage comes from a country with a high degree of skill in such activity, a
nation that has regularly orchestrated cyber warfare against other states, has one of the worst records
Page 112
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
when it comes to international cooperation against cyber crime, and has not signed the one serious
international agreement on disruptive cyber activity (the Council of Europe Cyber Crime Convention).
In rejecting the Russian proposal for an international agreement prohibiting cyber espionage, I
recognize that cyber espionage does have the potential to be damaging to diplomacy, to be provocative,
and possibly even destabilizing. As former NSA Director Ken Minihan said to me, â  We are conducting
warfare activities without thinking that it is war.â That is dangerous, but there may be other ways to
address those concerns. Over the course of the Cold War, the CIA and its Soviet counterpart, the KGB,
met secretly and developed tacit rules of the road. Neither side went around assassinating the otherâ s
agents. Certain things were generally out of bounds. There may be a parallel in cyber espionage. What I
recommend is consideration of quiet understandings. Countries need to recognize that cyber espionage
can easily be mistaken for preparation of the battlefield and that such actions may be seen to be
provocative. Nations should not do things in cyberspace that they would not do in the real world. If you
would not put a group of agents in somewhere to extract the information you are hoping to steal on the
Net, you probably should not take it electronically. Because there is so little difference between
extraction and sabotage, countries should be careful about where they prowl and what they take in
cyberspace.
While espionage targeting government systems may have gotten out of hand, Americaâ s real crown
jewels are not our government secrets, but our intellectual property. U.S. stockholders and taxpayers
spend billions of dollars funding research. China steals the results for pennies on the billions and then
takes the results to market. The only real economic edge that the U.S. enjoyed, our technological
research prowess, is disappearing as a result of cyber espionage. Calling it â  industrial espionageâ doesnâ t
alter the fact that it is crime. By hacking commercial organizations around the world to steal non-defense
data to increase Chinaâ s profits, the government in Beijing has become a cleptocracy on a global scale.
Even if a major cyber war involving the U.S. never happens, Chinese cyber espionage and intellectual
property war may swing the balance of power in the world away from America. We need to make
protecting this information a much higher priority, and we need to confront China about its activities.
If consequences can be created for certain kinds of destabilizing cyber espionage, countries may more
tightly control who does it, why it is done, and where it is done. Most bureaucrats want to avoid scenes
in which they have to explain to an outraged Secretary of State, or similar senior official, how the
intelligence value of an exposed covert operation was supposed to outweigh the damage done by its
discovery. Thus, while I recognize that some cyber espionage may have the potential to be less valuable
than the corresponding amount of damage it may cause, I think that risk is best handled by discussions
among intelligence organizations and governments bilaterally, privately. An arms control agreement
limiting cyber espionage is not clearly in our interest, might be violated regularly by other nations, and
would pose significant compliance-enforcement problems.
BANNING CYBER WAR?
Would it be a good idea, then, to agree to an outright ban on cyber war as defined here (that is,
excluding cyber espionage)? An outright ban could, theoretically, prohibit the development or possession
of cyber war weapons, but there would be no way to enforce or verify such a ban. A ban could also be
articulated as a prohibition on the use of cyber weapons against certain targets or on their deployment
prior to the outbreak of hostilities, rather than their mere possession or their use in espionage. To judge
whether a ban on conducting cyber war would be in our interest, assuming it could be verified, letâ s look
at some hypothetical cases.
Imagine a scenario similar to the Israeli raid on the Syrian nuclear facility with which this book began.
Change the scenario slightly so that it is the United States that wants to prevent some rogue state from
developing a nuclear weapon and it is the United States that decides it has to bomb the covert site where
the nuclear weapon is going to be made. The U.S. might well have the same kind of capability to turn off
an adversaryâ s air defense system by employing a cyber weapon. If we had agreed to a ban on the use of
cyber weapons, we would face a choice between, on the one hand, violating the agreement, and, on the
other hand, sending in U.S. pilots without having done all that we could in advance to protect them. Few
Page 113
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
civilian or military leaders in this country would want to have to explain that U.S. aircraft were shot down,
U.S. pilots taken prisoner or killed, because even though we could have shut off the adversaryâ s air
defense system we did not because of an international agreement.
Or imagine a scenario in which the U.S. was already in a limited shooting war with some nation, as we
have been in recent history with such nations as Serbia, Iraq, Panama, Haiti, Somalia, and Libya. The
U.S. forces might be in a situation where they could substitute a cyber weapon for conventional
explosive, kinetic weapons. The cyber weapon might result in lower lethality and do less physical
damage, have less long-lasting effects. An outright ban on the use of cyber weapons would force the
U.S. to choose, once again, between violating the agreement and doing some unnecessary damage to the
adversary.
A simpler scenario would not involve a shooting war or a U.S. preemptive attack, but rather
something as routine as a U.S. ship sailing peacefully in international waters. In this scenario, a U.S.
destroyer sailing parallel to the North Korean coast would be attacked by a North Korean patrol boat,
which fires missiles at the destroyer. The U.S. ship might have a cyber weapon that could be beamed into
the guidance system of the incoming missiles, causing them to veer away. If there were an outright ban on
the use of cyber weapons, the U.S. might even be prohibited from using them to defend its forces from
an unprovoked attack.
The most difficult scenario in which to show restraint would be if cyber weapons were already being
used against us. If an adversary tried to shut down a U.S. military network or weapon system by using
cyber techiques, it would be tempting to ignore the international agreement and respond in kind.
The two sides of the case for and against a complete ban on the use of cyber war weapons are clear.
If we really believe that a ban on cyber weapons is in the U.S. interest, we should be willing to pay some
price to maintain the international standard of not using such weapons. We have been in situations in the
past where we might have enjoyed some immediate military advantage by using a nuclear weapon or a
chemical or biological weapon, but we have always decided that the larger U.S. interest is in maintaining
a global consensus against employing such weapons. Nonetheless, because cyber weapons can be less
lethal, banning their use in conjunction with kinetic combat may be hard to justify. If shots are already
being fired, using cyber weapons might not be destabilizing or escalatory if (and this is a very big if) their
use did not expand the scope of the war. The U.S. military will make the case (strongly) that cyber war
weapons are a U.S. advantage and that we have to use our technological advantage to compensate for
how thinly our forces are spread around the world and how sophisticated the conventional weapons have
become that are in the hands of possible opponents.
Balancing our desire for military flexibility with the need to address the fact that cyber war could
damage the U.S. significantly, it may be possible to craft international constraints short of a complete ban.
An international agreement that banned, under any circumstances, the use of cyber weapons is the most
extreme form of a ban. In the previous chapter, we looked briefly at the proposal of a no-first-use
agreement, which is a lesser option. A no-first-use agreement could simply be a series of mutual
declarations, or it could be a detailed international agreement. The focus could be on keeping cyber
attacks from starting wars, not on limiting their use once a conflict has started. We could apply the pledge
to all nations, or only to those nations that made a similar declaration or signed an agreement.
Saying we wonâ t be the first ones to use cyber weapons may in fact have more than just diplomatic
appeal in the international arena. The existence of the pledge might make it less likely that another nation
would initiate cyber weapons use because to do so would violate an international norm that employing
cyber weapons crosses a line, is escalatory, and potentially destabilizing. The nation that goes first and
violates an agreement has added a degree of international opprobrium to its actions and created in the
global community a presumption of misconduct. International support for that nationâ s underlying position
in the conflict might thus be undermined and the potential for international sanctions increased.
A no-first-use declaration could result in reduced flexibility in many of the kinds of cyber scenarios I
discussed above. Waiting to respond in kind once we detected that the cyber weapons had been used in
a conflict, or used specifically against us, may also create a disadvantage in the cyber war phase of a
conflict.

BANNING ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS?
There are less restrictive approaches than banning the use of cyber weapons, or even forswearing first
use. One possibility would be to issue a unilateral declaration or to agree to an international protocol
placing civilian targets off limits to nation-statesâ  use of cyber weapons. There is ample precedent in the
international laws of war for a limited ban on certain weapons or activities, as well as to treaties that call
for the protection of civilians caught up in wars.
In World War I, aircraft were used in combat for the first time. They were mainly employed for
reconnaissance, machine-gun strafing of troops, and attacking each other in the air, but some aircraft
were used to drop explosives on the enemy. This first, small use of aerial bombing opened the possibility
of creating larger aircraft in the future to carry more, and bigger, bombs. Within a decade bomber aircraft
were being manufactured. One of the earliest science fiction authors, H. G. Wells, vividly portrayed what
such bombing aircraft could do to a city in his 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come. By 1936 he
and the filmmaker Alexander Korda had adapted the book into a movie, Things to Come, which
horrified audiences. In 1938 in Amsterdam, an international conference agreed to limits on â  New Engines
of War.â That agreement led, later that year, to a â  Convention for the Protection of Civilian Populations
against Bombing from the Air.â
Unfortunately for Amsterdam, and most major cities in Europe and Asia, that agreement did not stop
Germany, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, or the Soviet Union from aerial carpet bombing
of cities in the war that started one year later. After World War II, nations tried again and wrote several
agreements limiting how future wars should be conducted. These treaties, negotiated in Switzerland,
became known as the Geneva Conventions. Convention Four covers the â  Protection of Civilian Persons
in Time of War.â Thirty years later the United Nations sponsored another series of conventions that
protected not only civilians, but also military personnel against certain kinds of weapons that were thought
to be destabilizing or heinous. The conventions were given the cumbersome title â  Prohibitions or
Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weaponsâ ¦Excessively Injurious or Hav[ing]
Indiscriminate Effects.â Five specific protocols were agreed on, banning or limiting the use of established
weapons such as land mines and incendiaries, as well as the new application of commercial laser
technology to weaponry.
More recently the International Criminal Court agreement, which entered into force in 2002, banned
intentionally targeting civilians. The United States has withdrawn from the Court treaty and has gained
agreement from many nations that they would not support the prosecution of U.S. military personnel by
the Court.
Either the Geneva convention on â  Protection of Civiliansâ in war or the UN convention on weapons
with â  Indiscriminate Effectsâ could be expanded to deal with this new kind of warfare. Cyber weapons
used against a nationâ s infrastructure would inevitably result in attacking civilian systems. Nothing could
be more indiscriminate that attacking such things as a nationâ s power grid or transportation system. While
such broad-based attacks would diminish a nationâ s military capacity, some military capabilities will suffer
less than similar civilian infrastructure. The military are more likely to have backup power systems,
stockpiled food, and emergency field hospitals. A broad-based cyber attack on a nationâ s infrastructure
could keep the power grid off-line for weeks, pipelines unable to move oil and gas, trains sidelined,
airlines grounded, banks unable to dispense cash, distribution systems crippled, and hospitals working at
severely limited capacity. Civilian populations could well be left in cold, darkened dwellings with little
access to food, money, medical care, or news about what was happening. Looting and a crime wave
could follow. The number of fatalities would depend upon the duration and geographic scope of the
outages. While such casualties would, however, be far fewer than those resulting from an aerial bombing
campaign against cities, a sophisticated national cyber attack would definitely affect civilians, and might
even be designed to do so.
Extending existing international agreements to protect civilians against cyber attacks has advantages for
the United States. It allows the U.S. to continue to do what it is good at, cyber war against military
targets, including going first. Sophisticated cyber weapons may allow the U.S. to continue to have
Page 115
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
technological superiority in potential military conflicts, even as other nations deploy modern conventional
weapons with capabilities that approach or equal those of American forces. Cyber weapons may also
allow the U.S. to compensate in local or regional situations where the American forces are outnumbered.
Limiting U.S. cyber attacks to military targets would mean that we could not disrupt another nationâ s
military as a side effect of a general attack on a civilian power grid or railroad system. It is likely,
however, that U.S. cyber warriors have the capability to narrowly attack military targets such as
command and control grids, air defense networks, and specific weapons systems. Thus, by respecting a
ban on attacking civilian targets, the U.S. may not lose much or any capability needed that they need to
dominate an adversary.
The U.S. is not very good at cyber defense, nor is anybody else; but the U.S. civilian infrastructure is
more vulnerable, and thus the U.S. stands to suffer more from a broad national cyber attack than would
most other nations. Because the U.S. military relies on the civilian infrastructure, a ban on cyber attacks
on civilian targets would protect the U.S. military, as well as what it would do to avoid inflicting harm on
people in general and on the economy.
If the U.S. thought such a limited ban on cyber weapons was in its interest and either proposed it or
agreed to it, there are two immediate follow on questions. First, how do you propose to verify it? Letâ s
get to that in a moment. Second, what does it mean with regard to â  preparation of the battlefieldâ? Do
we define an attack as including the penetration of a network, or the emplacement of a logic bomb, or is
it just the use of a logic bomb or other weapon? Specifically, what is it that we would be willing to agree
to stop doing?
Earlier, we came to the conclusion that a formal international agreement banning cyber espionage was
probably not a good idea for the United States. So, we would not ban the penetration of networks to
collect intelligence, and there is probably intelligence information that one could glean from hacking into a
railroadâ s control system. But what real intelligence value would there be to hacking into an electric gridâ s
controls? Hacking into an electric gridâ s controls and leaving a trapdoor to facilitate easy return can have
only one purpose: preparation for an attack. Leaving behind a logic bomb is even more obviously an act
of cyber war.
Theoretically, you could write a ban on cyber war attacks on civilian infrastructure that would not
explicitly prohibit placing trapdoors or logic bombs, but would rather just ban any act that actually causes
a disruption. This narrow ban would allow the U.S. to be in position to retaliate quickly against another
countryâ s civilian infrastructure if it attacked ours. Without preplacement of cyber weapons, it might be
difficult and time-consuming to attack networks. But by allowing countries to go around lacing one
anotherâ s networks with logic bombs, we would be missing the chief value of a ban on cyber attacks on
civilian infrastructure.
The main reason for a ban on cyber war against civilian infrastructures is to defuse the current (silent
but dangerous) situation in which nations are but a few keystrokes away from launching crippling attacks
that could quickly escalate into a large-scale cyber war, or even a shooting war. The logic bombs in our
electric grid, placed there in all likelihood by the Chinese military, and similar weapons the U.S. may have
or may be about to place in other nationsâ  networks, are as destabilizing as if secret agents had strapped
explosives to transmission towers, transformers, and generators. The cyber weapons are harder to
detect; and, with a few quick keystrokes from the other side of the globe, one disgruntled or rogue cyber
warrior might be able to let slip the dogs of war with escalating results, the limits of which we cannot
know.
Although we can imagine situations in which the U.S. might wish it had already put logic bombs in
some nationâ s civilian networks, the risks of allowing nations to continue this practice would seem to far
outweigh the value of preserving for ourselves that one option to attack. Thus, as part of a ban on
attacking civilian infrastructure with cyber weapons, we should probably agree that the prohibition include
the penetration of civilian infrastructure networks for the purpose of placing logic bombs, and even the
emplacement of trapdoors on networks that control systems such as electric power grids.
BEGINNING WITH THE BANKS?
Page 116
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Even an agreement limited to protecting civilian infrastructure may pose problems. Some nations, like
Russia, might contend that a U.S. willingness to accept such an agreement confirms their point that cyber
weapons are dangerous. They could hold out for a complete ban. Negotiating a verification arrangement
for even a civilian-protection protocol could, as we will discuss shortly, open a Pandoraâ s box of
complications. Therefore, the U.S. may want to consider an even more limited scope for an initial
international agreement on cyber weapons. One option might be an accord designed to preclude cyber
attacks on the international financial system. Every major nation has a stake in the reliability of the data
that underpin international bank clearinghouses, their major member banks, and the major stock and
commodity trading exchanges. With few exceptions, such as the impoverished rogue state of North
Korea, to launch an attack on an element of the international financial system would likely be
self-defeating. The damage to the system could directly hurt the attacker, and certainly the financial
retaliation that would result from the identification of an attacking nation could cripple a nationâ s
economy.
Because of the interlocking nature of major global financial institutions, including individual banks, even
a cyber attack on one nationâ s financial infrastructure could have a fast-moving ripple effect, undermining
confidence globally. And, as one Wall Street CEO told me, â  It is confidence in the data, not the gold
bullion in the basement of the New York Fed, that makes the world financial markets work.â
The belief that cyber attacks on banks could unravel the entire global financial system has prevented
successive U.S. administrations from approving proposals to hack into banks and steal funds from
terrorists and dictators, including Saddam Hussein. As Admiral McConnell has noted, â  What happens if
someone who is not deterred attacks a large bank in New York and contaminates or destroys the data?
Suddenly there is a level of uncertainty and loss of confidence. Without confidence that transactions are
safe and will reconcile, financial transactions will stop.â Thus, since we seem to have a self-imposed ban
anyway, it would probably be in the interest of the United States to propose or participate in an
international agreement to forswear cyber attacks targeted on financial institutions. (Such an agreement
need not prohibit cyber espionage. There might be intelligence value from observing financial transactions
in banks, such as identifying the money of terrorists. The U.S. may already be doing just that. It
apparently came as a shock to European financial institutions in 2006 that the U.S., seeking to track
terrorist funds, may have been covertly monitoring the international financial transactions of the SWIFT
bank-clearing system.)
INSPECTORS IN CYBERSPACE
The value of international agreements to ban certain kinds of cyber warfare activities, or pledges not to
engage in such attacks first, may depend in part upon whether violations can be detected and whether
blame can be assigned. Traditional arms control verification is very different from anything that would
work in cyberspace. To verify compliance with numerical limits on submarines or missile silos, nations
had only to fly their space-based surveillance platforms overhead and take photographs. Itâ s hard to hide
a submarine-building shipyard or a missile base. For smaller objects, such as armored combat vehicles,
inspection teams were permitted into military bases to conduct inventories. To ensure no improper
activity at nuclear reactors, the International Atomic Energy Agencyâ s inspectors install surveillance
cameras and place seals and identification tags on nuclear material. International teams sample chemicals
at corporationsâ  chemical plants, looking for signs of covert chemical weapons production. To monitor
for nuclear weapons tests, an international network of seismic sensors has been netted together, with
nations sharing the data they detect.
Only that seismic network, and perhaps the IAEA teams, offers any useful precedent for cyber arms
control verification. You cannot detect or count cyber weapons from space, or even by driving around an
army base. No nation is likely to agree to having international teams of inspectors plowing through what
programs are on computer networks designed to protect classified information. Even if in some parallel
universe, nations did permit such intrusive inspection of their military or intelligence computer networks, a
nation could hide its cyber weapons on thumb drives or CDs anywhere in the country. A ban on
development, possession, or testing of cyber weapons on a closed network (such as the National Cyber
Page 117
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Range being developed by Johns Hopkins University and Lockheed Martin) is not something that could
be verified.
The actual use of cyber weapons, however, may be more clear-cut. The effects of an attack can often
be easily discerned. Computer forensic teams can generally determine what attack techniques were used,
even if they may not be able to determine how the penetration into the network occurred. The attribution
problem would persist, however, even in the case of an attack that has already taken place. Trace-back
techniques and ISP records may indicate that a particular nation is involved, but they would not usually
be able to prove a governmentâ s guilt with high confidence. A nation, perhaps the U.S., could easily be
framed. Cyber attacks against Georgia, probably orchestrated by Russia, came from a botnet control
computer in Brooklyn.
Even if a nation admitted that an attack came from computers on its territory, the government could
claim the attacks were from anonymous citizens. This is precisely the claim that the Russian government
did make in the case of the cyber attacks on Estonia and Georgia. It is exactly what the Chinese
government claimed when U.S. networks were hit from China in 2001, following the alleged penetration
of Chinese airspace by a U.S. electronic spy plane. It may even be true that the hackers would turn out
to be people without government jobs or offices, although they may have been encouraged and enabled
by their governments.
One way to address the attribution problem is to shift the burden from the investigator and accuser to
the nation in which the attack software was launched. This same burden shifting has been used in dealing
with international crime and with terrorism. In December 1999, Michael Sheehan, then the U.S.
ambassador for counterterrorism, had the job of delivering a simple message to the Taliban. Sheehan was
instructed to make it clear to the Taliban that they would be held responsible for any attack perpetrated
by al Qaeda against the United States or its allies. Late at night, Sheehan delivered the message through
an interpreter by telephone to a representative of the Taliban leader Mullah Omar. To drive home the
point, Sheehan used a simple analogy: â  If you have an arsonist in your basement; and every night he goes
out and burns down a neighborâ s house, and you know this is going on, then you canâ t claim you arenâ t
responsible.â Mullah Omar did not evict the arsonist in his basement, indeed he continued to harbor bin
Laden and his al Qaeda followers even after 9/11. Now it is Mullah Omar who is huddling in a basement
somewhere, hunted by NATO, U.S., and Afghan armies.
The notion contained in the â  arsonist principleâ is one that can be applied to cyber war. While we talk
about cyberspace as an abstract fifth dimension, it is made up of physical components. These physical
components, from the high-speed fiber-optic trunks, to every router, server, and â  telecom hotel,â are all
in sovereign nations, except perhaps for the undersea cables and the space-based relays. Even they are
owned by countries or companies that have real-world physical addresses. Some people like to contend
that there is a â  sovereignty problemâ on the Internet, that because no one owns cyberspace in its entirety,
no one has any responsiblility for its integrity or security. The arsonist principle, articulated in an
international agreement as National Cyberspace Accountability, would make each person, company,
ISP, and country responsible for the security of their piece of cyberspace.
At a minimum, countries like Russia could no longer claim that they have no control over so-called
patriotic hacktivists. An international agreement could hold host governments responsible either for
stopping these hackers from participating in illegal international activities, or at least requiring nations to
make their best effort to do so. In addition to their own police activities, a nation that is party to an
international agreement might have an obligation to assist. Such an obligation could require them to
respond quickly to inquiries in international investigations, seize and preserve server or router records,
host and facilitate international investigators, produce their citizens for questioning, and prosecute citizens
for specified crimes.
The existing 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cyber Crime already incorporates many of these
obligations to assist. The United States is a party to the convention. Our sovereignty is not being infringed
upon by some supranational Olde Europa bureaucracy. Rather, by signing the convention, the U.S. is
promising to pass any new legislation necessary to provide the U.S. government with the authority to do
the things necessary to meet the obligations in the agreement.
Page 118
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Going beyond the current cyber crime convention, however, a cyber war convention could make
nations responsible for ensuring that their ISPs deny service to individuals and devices participating in
attacks and report them to authorities. Such a provision would mean that ISPs would have to be able to
detect and â  black-holeâ major worms, botnets, DDOS attacks, and other obvious malicious activity.
(Some of this process of identifying malware is something far less difficult than deep-packet inspection
and can be done largely by something called â  flow analysis,â which really means nothing more than
watching how much traffic is moving on the network and looking for unusual spikes or patterns.) If a
nation did not successfully compel an ISP into compliance, the international agreement could establish a
procedure that transferred responsibility to other nations. An ISP could be internationally black-listed. All
participating nations would then be required to refuse traffic going to or from that ISP until it complied
and stopped the botnets or other obvious malware.
Such an international agreement would deal with a portion of the attribution problem, by shifting
responsibility. Even if the attacker could not be identified, at least there would be someone who could be
held responsible for stopping the attack and investigating who the attacker was. Such an obligation would
not require most nations to add new cyber forensics units. Nations like China and Russia have the ability
now to identify and move quickly against hackers. As Jim Lewis of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies has said, â  If a hacker in St. Petersburg tried to break into the Kremlin system, that
hacker could count the remaining hours of his life on one hand.â You can be sure that the same is true for
anyone in China trying to hack the Peopleâ s Liberation Army network. If China and Russia signed a
cyber war agreement with obligations like the ones suggested here, those governments could no longer
blame their citizens for DDOS attacks on other nations and then stand back and do nothing. Failure to
act promptly against citizen hackers would result in the nation itself being held in violation of the
agreement and, more important, in other nations disconnecting all traffic from the offending ISPs. Nations
could black-hole such rogue traffic from other countries now, but in the absence of a legal framework,
they are reluctant to do so. An agreement would not only permit nations from blocking such traffic, it
would require them to do so.
A National Cyberspace Accountability provision and its corollary Obligation to Assist would not
completely solve the attribution problem. The Russian botnet attack could still come from Brooklyn. The
Taiwanese hacker sitting in the San Francisco cyber cafÃ© could still attack a Chinese government
website. But under such an agreement the U.S. would have to stop the botnet and actively investigate the
hacker. In the case of a hypothetical Taiwanese agent hacking into Chinese networks in violation of an
international agreement, the U.S. government, when notified by China of such activity, would have to task
the FBI or Secret Service to help the Chinese police track down the culprit in San Francisco. If he was
found, he could be tried in a U.S. court for violation of U.S. law.
Of course, nations may say that they are looking for hackers and not be. They may try culprits and find
them not guilty. When notified of a botnet originating on an ISP in their country, nations may take their
sweet time doing something about it. To judge whether a nation is actively complying or is just being
passive-aggressive, it may be useful if a cyber war agreement created an â  International Cyber Forensics
and Compliance Staff.â The staff of experts could make reports to member states on whether or not a
nation is acting in the spirit of the agreement. There could be international inspection teams, similar to
those under the nuclear nonproliferation agreement, the chemical weapons ban, and the European
security and cooperation agreement. Such teams could be invited in by signatory nations to assist in
verifying that a cyber war attack had occurred in violation of the agreement. They could help determine
what nation had actually launched the attack. The international staff might also, with the voluntary
cooperation of member states, place traffic-flow monitoring equipment at key nodes leading into a nationâ 
s networks to help detect and identify the origin of attacks.
The international staff might also run a center that nations could contact whenever they believed they
were coming under a cyber war attack. Imagine that an Israeli network is hit with a botnet DDOS attack
from an ISP in Alexandria, Egypt, at three in the morning, Tel Aviv time. Israel, like all signatory countries
in our hypothetical agreement, would have a national cyber security liaison office constantly staffed. The
Israeli center would call the international center, say, in Tallinn, and report that a cyber attack was
Page 119
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
originating from a certain ISP in Egypt. The international center would then call the Egyptian national
center in Cairo and request that they immediately investigate whether there is a botnet operating on that
ISP in Alexandria. The international staff would time how long it took Egypt to comply and shut down the
attack. Perhaps the international staff would be able to look at traffic-flow monitors on gateways coming
out of Egypt and see the botnet spike. Egypt would be required to respond with a report on its
investigation of the attack. If the incident warranted it, the international staff might ask to send a team of
investigators to assist or observe the Egyptian authorities. The international staff could file a report, with
conclusions and recommendations, to member states on the incident.
Nations that were found to be scofflaws could be subject to a range of sanctions. In addition to having
traffic to and from offending ISPs denied by ISPs in other member states, the offending nation could have
its hands slapped by the international organization. For more drastic action, nations could deny visas to
officials from the offending nation, limit exports of new IT equipment to the nation, limit the overall
amount of cyber traffic to and from the nation, or disconnect the nation altogether from international
cyber space for a period of time.
These verification and compliance provisions in a cyber war agreement would not totally solve the
attribution problem. They would not prevent a nation from spoofing the source of an attack or framing
another state. They would, however, make it more difficult for some kinds of cyber war attacks, while
establishing norms of international behavior, providing international legal cover for nations to assist, and
creating an international community of cooperating experts in fighting cyber war. It is also important to
remember that the capability to conduct attacks that amount to cyber war currently requires a state-level
effort, and only a handful of states have advanced capabilities. The list of potential attackers is small.
Attribution is a major problem for cyber crime, but for warfare, technical forensics and real-world
intelligence can narrow down the list of suspects fairly quickly.
What emerges from this discussion of cyber arms control are five broad conclusions. First, unlike other
forms of arms control that destroy weapons, cyber arms control cannot eliminate capability. It can only
prohibit acts. Thus, a nation could move from a state of compliance to a gross violation in seconds and
without warning.
Second, broad definitions of cyber warfare, such as those that include espionage, are not verifiable
and are not in our interest as a nation. Nonetheless, national intelligence services and national
governments should initiate channels for discussions so that intelligence activities do not get out of hand,
or become misconstrued as showing hostile intentions.
Third, international agreements that prohibit certain acts, such as cyber attacks on civilian
infrastructure, are in our interest. Because such attacks could still take place, such agreements would not
in any way diminish the need to take defensive steps to protect that infrastructure.
Fourth, high-confidence verification of compliance with a cyber war limitation agreement will not be
possible. We may be able to verify a violation, but attribution of the attack will be difficult and could be
subject to intentionally misleading activity. Nonetheless, there are measures that can contribute to an
international norm against cyber attacks on civilians, namely, an expert international staff, national
governmental responsibility for the prevention of violations originating within a nationâ s borders, and an
obligation to assist in stopping and investigating attacks.
Finally, limits on cyber war attacks against civilian infrastructure would probably mean that we and
other states would have to cease any activity in which we may be engaged with logic bombs, and
perhaps trapdoors, in other nationsâ  civilian infrastructure networks. Lacing infrastructure with trapdoors
and logic bombs, although little noticed or discussed by the media and the general population, is
dangerously provocative. They are alluring because they offer some of the results of war, but without
soldiers or death. But they also signal hostile intent far more than any weapon that stays in a nationâ s
inventory. They could be utilized easily and quickly, without proper authorization, or without a full
appreciation for what kind of spiral of escalation they might cause. Although a war might start in
cyberspace and be conducted without soldiers or bloodshed, it would be highly unlikely to stay that way
for long. By lacing on anotherâ s infrastructure networks with cyber weapons, nations have made starting
a war far too easy.

CHAPTER EIGHT
THE AGENDA
Invisibly, military units from over a score of nations are moving into a new battlespace. Because the units
are unseen, parliaments and publics have not noticed the movement of these forces. Because their first
skirmishes have been isolated and involved only simple weapons, few have thought that cyber warriors
could do more. Because most of the major military powers are also one anotherâ s trading partners,
commentators cannot envision the circumstances that could turn their relations to hostility. Because the
United States has been at war in one nation for seven years and in another for nine, is struggling with its
worst-ever recession, and is diverted by partisanship, the â  bandwidthâ of its policy elites is already
consumed. Thus, with attention diverted elsewhere, we may be laying the groundwork for cyber war.
There may be parallels in the early years of the last century. Barbara Tuchman in The Proud Tower
describes a world similarly diverted from the realization that its various militaries were preparing
devastating forces without contemplating the horrific consequences of their use. Then, as she describes in
the sequel, The Guns of August, a spark caused those forces to be activated. Von Schlieffenâ s
elaborate military use of Germanyâ s massive new freight rail network literally set wheels in motion that
could not be stopped. The military use of the new chemical industry added an element of destructiveness.
The use of chemical weapons did far more damage than anyone had anticipated. Today our military is
developing elaborate plans for a new kind of war, once again using a technology originally designed for
commercial use. As in the period one hundred years ago, those plans have received little public scrutiny.
There have been few times in our history when the American academic community, the media, and the
Congress have focused on a potential problem and together cast so much light on an issue that controls
were put in place that averted calamity. The issue of strategic nuclear war, referenced much in this book,
is the clearest example. A new technology had burst upon the world and the U.S. military had seen in it a
way to achieve military dominance and, through that, peace. At airbases with the signs â  Peace Is Our
Profession,â the plans called for early and massive use of nuclear weapons in a war, against cities and
civilian targets. Not until the research community focused a public klieg light on those plans and the larger
issue of how to fight nuclear war, were rational controls and plans developed and adopted.
Today at U.S. Cyber Command, and at its related agencies, some of our nationâ s most intelligent,
patriotic, and undercompensated government employees, military and civilian, are putting plans and
capabilities in place to achieve â  dominance in cyberspaceâ to maintain this countryâ s security and
preserve the peace. In other nations, cyber war units are also preparing. As part of that preparation,
cyber warriors are placing trapdoors in civilian networks, placing logic bombs in electric power grids,
and seeding infrastructure for destruction. They believe that their new form of warfare is an advance, not
just because of its use of the latest technology, but because it does not involve explosives and direct
lethality. Like the Predator pilots who sit in the United States, killing Taliban in Pakistan by remote
control, they could subconsciously think that because they live in a peaceful suburban environment, the
effects of their destruction on the other side of the world may somehow be clean and neat, unlike â  real
war.â
When in a period of rising tensions, in some future crisis now unforeseen, a cyber warrior of some
nation is ordered to â  send a messageâ to the potential adversary by using one of the logic bombs already
in place, will it forestall or will it trigger a broader shooting war? Perhaps because the opponent is misled
about who started the war, other nations will be drawn in. Possibly, the cyber warrior in one of the score
of nations with capability will act without authority, initiating a conflict. Alternatively, it may be a hacker
who uses a cyber weapon for destruction rather than crime, or discovers and sets off a logic bomb left
behind by someone else. The cyber war that ensues could be incredibly rapid and global.
When an American President sends U.S. forces to bomb a rogue stateâ s nuclear weapons factory or
terrorist camp, that nation may not be able to respond against our impressive conventional military forces.
And yet, for a small investment in a cyber war capability, it may respond by destroying the international
financial system, in which it has very little stake. The asymmetry of what it costs to counter our
Page 121
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
conventional military versus the minimal investment required for a cyber war capability will tempt other
nations, and perhaps criminal cartels and terrorist groups as well.
Because the U.S. invented the Internet and has perhaps led in cyber espionage and the creation of
cyber war tools, it may have developed an implicit arrogance, causing us to assume that no one could
humble America in a cyber war. Our cyber warriors and, to the extent that they think of cyber war, our
national security leaders in general, may take comfort in the fact that we could perhaps see a cyber attack
coming. They may think that we could block some of it, and they may believe we could respond in kind,
and then some. The reality is that a major cyber attack from another nation is likely to originate in the
U.S., so we will not be able to see it coming and block it with the systems we have now or those that are
planned. Yes, we may be able to respond in kind, but our nation will still be devastated by a massive
cyber attack on civilian infrastructure that smacks down power grids for weeks, halts trains, grounds
aircraft, explodes pipelines, and sets fires to refineries.
The reality may also be that when the U.S. President wants to retaliate further, he will be the one who
will have to escalate. He will be the one who will have to cross the cyber/kinetic boundary. And he may
find, when he does, that even our conventional forces are cyber dependent. The U.S. militaryâ s reliance
upon cyber systems exceeds the extensive dependence of the commercial infrastructure. The contractors
required for America to fight a war may be immobilized by cyber attack. The allegedly hermetically
sealed computer networks upon which the Department of Defense relies may prove porous and
unavailable. Highly advanced technology in the conventional weapons and systems that give U.S. forces
dominance (for example, the F-35 fighter and the Global Positioning System) may suddenly not work.
We are not the only nation that can install a logic bomb.
With a nation in the dark, shivering in the cold, unable to get food at the market or cash at the ATM,
with parts of our military suddenly impotent, and with the regional flashpoint that started it all going badly,
what will the Commander-in-Chief do? Perhaps he will appoint a commission to investigate what went
wrong. That commission will read the work of another commission, one appointed by Bill Clinton in
1996, and be astonished to learn that this disaster was foreseen back then. They will note the advice of a
non-government commission written in 2008 advising the next President to take cyber war seriously.
They may, if they are diligent, find a National Academy of Sciences study on Offensive Information
Warfare from 2009 that warned that cyber war policy was â  ill-formed, undeveloped, and highly
uncertain.â
The post-disaster commission, a special committee of the Congress, or the next President would likely
recommend a plan so that â  this sort of thing can never happen again.â Since we know now what has
been recommended already, what hasnâ t worked, and why, perhaps we should not wait for a disaster to
embark on a plan to deal with cyber war. If we strip away the luxuries and the things that would be nice
to have, there are six simple steps that we need to take simultaneously and now to avert a cyber war
disaster.
1. THINKING ABOUT THE UNSEEABLE
First, we must initiate a broad public dialogue about cyber war. A student looking to choose a graduate
school asked me recently to recommend a university where she could take courses on cyber war. We
scoured course catalogues and found none at any of the major security-policy schools, such as Harvardâ s
Kennedy School, Princetonâ s Woodrow Wilson School, or Texasâ s Lyndon Johnson School. She asked
what books she should read and we found some interesting titles, but few that really delved into the
policy and technology of cyber war. Many that seemed promising turned out to use the phrase
â  information warâ to mean psychological warfare or public diplomacy.
Perhaps there are few books on cyber war because so much of the subject matter is secret. Maybe
there should be public discussion precisely because so much of the work has been stamped secret. In the
1950s and 1960s, people like Herman Kahn, Bill Kaufmann, and Albert Wohlstetter were told that
nuclear war was something that could not really be discussed publicly. One of Kahnâ s responses was a
book called Thinking About the Unthinkable (1962), which contributed to a robust public dialogue
about the moral, ethical, and strategic dimensions of nuclear war. Open research and writing done at
Page 122
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
MIT, Harvard, Prince ton, Chicago, and Stanford also contributed. Bill Kaufmannâ s classes at MIT,
Harvard, and the Brookings Institution taught two generations how to think about nuclear strategy and
how to ask analytical questions, so that they could think on their own. Today at Harvard and MIT, the
aptly named Project Minerva, an open research program on cyber war funded by the Defense
Department, has begun. (I am reminded of Hegelâ s dictum that â  the owl of Minerva always flies at dusk,â
meaning that wisdom comes too late.)
The mainstream mediaâ s treatment of cyber war has improved. Reporters at the Wall Street Journal
and the New York Times have written on it since 2008. Public televisionâ s highly respected Front-line
series did an hourlong examination in 2003, Cyber War. Television has focused much more on identity
theft by cyber criminals because so many readers and viewers have already been victimized by cyber
crime. Movies, however, have been filled with cyber war. In Live Free or Die Hard, a former
government cyber security official who wasnâ t listened to (whom the New York Times reviewer said was
reminiscent of me. Nonsense!) cripples national systems. In Eagle Eye, hacking causes high-tension lines
to melt and general havoc to erupt. In The Italian Job, the hacking is limited to traffic lights, but in
Oceanâ s Eleven there is a power blackout in Las Vegas. There are so many more that much of the
moviegoing public has little trouble understanding what cyber war can do. High-level policy officials
apparently seldom make it to the movies. Or maybe they think itâ s all just fantasy. To make them
understand that such scenarios can really happen, we need an exercise program to drive home the point.
General Ken Minihan has been promoting the idea of an Eligible Receiverâ type war game for the private
sector. â  We could scare the pants off them, the way we did for the President in â 97.â
Congress, surprisingly, has held numerous hearings on cyber security and has tasked its Government
Accountability Office to investigate. One GAO report asked whether the warnings that hackers could
attack a power grid were true. GAO investigated one of the few power grids owned and operated by the
federal government, the Tennessee Valley Authorityâ s system. GAO reported back in 2008 that there
were significant cyber security vulnerabilities on the TVA grid that left it open to attack. On cyber war,
however, as distinct from cyber security in general, Congress has done little in the way of oversight,
hearings, or legislation.
Congress is a federation of fiefdoms, subject to the vicissitudes of constant fund raising and the
lobbying of those who have donated the funds. That situation has two adverse consequences with regard
to congressional involvement in cyber war oversight. First, everyone wants his or her own fiefdom.
Congress has resisted any suggestion, such as was made by Senator Bob Bennett (Republican of Utah),
that there be one committee authorized to examine cyber security. As a result there are approximately
twenty-eight committees and subcommittees involved in the issue and none with jurisdiction to think
holistically. Second, Congress â  eschews regulationâ and spits it out. The influential donors from the
information technology, electric power, pipeline, and telecommunications industries have made the idea of
serious cyber security regulations as remote as public financing of congressional campaigns or meaningful
limits on campaign contributions.
The dialogue we need will require meaningful academic research and teaching, a shelf of new books,
in-depth journalism, and serious congressional oversight.
2. THE DEFENSIVE TRIAD
The next item on the agenda to prevent cyber war is the creation of the Defensive Triad. As proposed
earlier in this book, the Triad stops malware on the Internet at the backbone ISPs, hardens the controls
of the electric grid, and increases the security of the Defense Departmentâ s networks and the integrity of
its weapons. Much of the work in DoD has already begun as a result of President Bushâ s decision in his
last year in office. The Defensive Triad is not an attempt, as my National Strategy for Cybersecurity was,
to defend everything. The Triad is, however, designed to defend enough so as to cause another nation to
think twice before launching a cyber war against us. A potential attacker needs to believe that much of his
attack will fail and that its greatest effect will be retaliation of various sorts. Without the Defensive Triad,
the U.S. should itself be deterred from acting in any way (not just in cyber war) that could provoke
someone into a cyber war attack on America. Today we are so vulnerable to a devastating cyber war
Page 123
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
attack that U.S. leaders should walk cautiously.
We cannot build two of the three prongs of the Defensive Triad (the defense of the Tier 1 ISPs and of
the electric power) without additional regulation. The argument I have made in the past about homeland
security in general is that without using regulation the federal government is trying to achieve security with
one of its arms tied behind its back. There was an era when federal regulations were overly intrusive and
ineffective, but that is not inherent in the idea of the government asking industries to avoid doing some
things and defining desired end states. At the Black Hat conference in 2009 (discussed earlier), the cyber
security expert and author Bruce Schneier made the same point, arguing that â  smart regulationâ that
specifies the goal and does not dictate the path is needed to improve cyber security.
Our cyber war agenda must include regulation that requires the Tier 1 ISPs to engage in deep-packet
inspection for malware and to do so with the highest standards of privacy protection and oversight. The
ISPs must be given the legal protection necessary so that they do not have to fear being sued for stopping
viruses, worms, DDOS attacks, phishing, and other forms of malware. Indeed, they must be required to
do so by new regulations.
In order for the Department of Homeland Security to fulfill its role in the Defensive Triad, we must
create a reliable and highly qualified component, perhaps a Cyber Defense Administration. The Cyber
Defense Administration should be responsible for overseeing the deep-packet inspection system that the
ISPs will run. It should also be responsible for monitoring the health of the Internet in real time, take over
responsibility for regulating cyber security of the power sector from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC), and provide a focal point for law enforcement activities related to cyber crime. The
Cyber Defense Administrationâ s most important role, however, would be to manage the defense of both
the dot-gov domain and critical infrastructure during an attack.
The administration could provide the ISPs with known signatures of malware in real time, in addition to
being a vehicle for the ISPs sharing what they themselves discover. The existing National
Communications System, a four-decade-old office that worked on telephone availability in emergencies,
and which was recently merged into the new National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration
Center (NCCIC, but pronounced â  en-kickâ), could provide the ISPs with an out-of-band
communications system that could pass these malware signatures. The Cyber Defense Administration
could draw on the expertise of the Pentagon and intelligence agencies, but the National Security Agency
must not be given the mission of protecting domestic U.S. cyber networks. As uniquely skilled as NSAâ s
experts are, they and their agency suffer from a public distrust exacerbated by the warrantless
wiretapping ordered by Bush and Cheney.
Beyond regulating the ISPs, the other area of regulation needed is the electric power grid. The only
way to secure the grid is to require encryption of commands to the devices running the system, along with
authentication of the sender, and a series of completely out-of-band channels that are not connected to
the companiesâ  intranets or the public Internet. The FERC has not required that, but it did finally issue
some regulations in 2008. It has not yet started to enforce them. When it does, do not expect much. That
commission completely lacks the skills and personnel needed to ensure that electric power companies
disconnect their controls from any pathway that a hacker could use. The mission of auditing the electric
companiesâ  compliance should also be given to the Cyber Defense Administration, where the expertise
could be built and where the overly chummy relationship with the industry exhibited by the FERC would
not get in the way of security.
The Cyber Defense Administration should also assume the cyber security responsibility for the myriad
civilian federal departments and agencies, all of which are now forced to try to do cyber security on their
networks. Also, consolidating in the proposed Cyber Defense Administration what is now done on cyber
security by the Office of Management and Budget and the General Services Administration would
increase the probability of achieving a center of excellence that could manage security on the governmentâ 
s own civilian (not Defense) networks.
3. CYBER CRIME
Because cyber criminals can become rental cyber warriors, we need as the third agenda item to reduce
Page 124
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
the level of cyber criminality that is plaguing the Internet. Cyber criminals have begun to penetrate the
supply chains for both computer hardware and software manufacturers to inject malicious code. Instead
of just using widely available hacking tools, cyber criminals are now starting to write their own specially
designed code to beat security systems, as was the case in the theft of millions of credit card numbers
from T.J. Maxx in 2003. These trends point to the growing sophistication of cyber criminals, and may
indicate that the criminal threat could grow to become as sophisticated as the state-level threat. That
suggests we need to increase our efforts to combat cyber crime.
Today both the FBI and the Secret Service investigate cyber crime, with help from Customs (now
called Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE) and the Federal Trade Commission. Yet
companies and citizens across the country complain that their reports of cyber crime go unanswered. The
Justice Departmentâ s ninety independent prosecutors scattered around the nation often ignore cyber
crime because individual cyber thefts usually fall below the $100,000 minimum necessary for a federal
case to be authorized. The U.S. attorneys are also often computer illiterate and do not want to investigate
a crime where the culprit is in some other city or, worse yet, another country.
The President could assign the FBI and Secret Service agents who cover cyber crime to the proposed
Cyber Defense Administration, along with attorneys to prepare cases for the Justice Department. A
single national investigatory center within the Cyber Defense Administration, coordinating the work of
regional teams, could develop the expertise, detect patterns, and engage in the international liaison
needed to increase the probability of arrest to the point where it might begin to be a deterrent. Today law
enforcement in the U.S. does not begin to deter the worldâ s cyber criminals. Today cyber crime does
pay. To make it stop paying, the U.S. would need to make a substantially greater investment in federal
law enforcement agenciesâ  cyber crime capability. We will also have to do something about cyber crime
sanctuaries.
In the late 1990s, international criminal cartels were laundering hundreds of billions of dollars through
â  banksâ in a variety of mini-nations, usually island states, as well as several larger sanctuary nations. The
major financial powers got together, agreed on a model law criminalizing money laundering, and told the
sanctuary states to pass the law and enforce it. If they didnâ t, the countries were told that the major
international financial nations would all stop clearing their local currencies and halt financial transactions
with their banks. I had the pleasure of conveying that message to the Prime Minister of the Bahamas,
where the law was promptly passed. Money laundering did not disappear, but it got a lot harder because
there were fewer reliable sanctuaries. The signatories of the Council of Europe Convention on Cyber
Crime should do the same kind of thing to cyber crime sanctuaries. Together they need to tell Russia,
Belarus, and the other scofflaws that they either have to start enforcing laws against cyber crime or there
will be consequences. One of the consequences would be to limit and inspect all Internet traffic entering
nations from the scofflaw sanctuaries. Itâ s worth a try.
4. CWLT
The fourth component of the agenda to address cyber war should be the equivalent of the Strategic Arms
Limitation Treaty (SALT) for cyber war, a Cyber War Limitation Treaty, or CWLT (pronounced â  see
-waltâ). The U.S. should coordinate the proposal with its key allies in advance of suggesting it at the
United Nations. As the name implies, it should limit cyber war, not seek some global ban on hacking or
intelligence gathering. SALT and its follow-on Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) not only
accepted intelligence collection as an inevitability, they relied upon it and called for â  noninterferenceâ with
it. Those treaties explicitly protected what they called â  national technical means.â
When arms control worked well, it had begun somewhat modestly and then expanded its scope in
subsequent agreements as confidence and experience had grown. CWLT should begin by doing the
following in an initial agreement:
ï· establish a Cyber Risk Reduction Center to exchange information and provide
nations with assistance;
ï· create as international-law concepts the obligation to assist and national
cyber accountability, as discussed earlier;
Page 125
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
ï· impose a ban on first-use cyber attacks against civilian infrastructure, a ban
that would be lifted when (a) the two nations were in a shooting war, or (b) the
defending nation had been attacked by the other nation with cyber weapons;
ï· prohibit the preparation of the battlefield in peacetime by the emplacement of
trapdoors or logic bombs on civilian infrastructure, including electric power
grids, railroads, and so on; and
ï· prohibit altering data or damaging networks of financial institutions at any time,
including the preparation to do so by the emplacement of logic bombs.
Later, after experience with CWLT One, we could examine whether to expand its scope. We
should begin with a no-first-use ban on cyber attacks against civilian targets, rather than an
outright ban, because nations should not be disingenuous when they sign obligations. Nations that
are engaged in a shooting war or have been the victims of cyber attack will probably employ
cyber weapons. Moreover, we do not want to force nations that have been the victim of cyber
attack to retaliate with kinetic weapons because of a ban on cyber attacks. The proposal does
not preclude initial cyber attacks on military targets. Nor does it rule out preparation of the
battlefield against military targets, because proposals to do so raise complex trade-offs and
would overburden CWLT One. Nonetheless, lacing each otherâ s military with logic bombs is
destabilizing and we should say publicly that if we discover it happening to us we would consider
it as a demonstration of hostile intent.
Non-state actors will be a problem for cyber arms control, but CWLT should shift the burden
of stopping them to the states party to the convention. Nations would be required to rigorously
monitor for hacking originating in their country and to prevent hacking activity from inside their
territory. They would be required to act promptly to stop such activity when notified of it by
other nations through an international Cyber Threat Reduction Center. That Center would be
created by the treaty, paid for by signatories, and be staffed at all times by network and cyber
security experts. The Center could also dispatch computer forensics teams to assist in
investigations and to determine whether nations are actively and assiduously investigating
reported violations. The treaty would include a concept of national cyber accountability,
making it a treaty violation if a nation did not stop a threat when notified by the Center. It would
also include the obligation to assist the Center and other signatories.
The treaty will also have to deal with the attribution problem, which is not just a matter of
nations organizing their citizen hacktivists. The hacktivist problem might be addressed by the
provisions in the treaty we have just discussed. Attribution is also a problem because nations
route attacks through other countries and sometimes actually initiate them from another nation.
The Center could investigate claims by nations that they were not the source of an attack, and it
could issue reports to allow the member states to judge if there had been a treaty violation by a
particular state. If there had been a clear violation, the states party to the treaty could issue
sanctions. The sanctions could range across a spectrum from, at the low end, denying visas or
entry to specific individuals, to denying Internet connectivity to an ISP. At the higher end, nations
could limit international Internet and telephone traffic flows for a country. The Center could put
scanners on the points where traffic from the country came into other nations. Finally, of course,
nations could refer the problem to the United Nations and recommend broader economic and
other sanctions.
The treaty and the Center would only be concerned with cyber war. It would not become an
international regulatory body for the Internet, as some have proposed. Burdening CWLT with
that possibility will ensure that it is opposed by many interests in the U.S. and elsewhere. CWLT
will not, by itself, stop attacks on civilian targets, but it will raise the price of trying them. The
advent of CWLT as an international norm will also send a message to cyber warriors and their
government masters that firing off a cyber attack is not the first thing that you do when your
neighbor state has made you mad. Engaging in offensive cyber war against another country would
become, after CWLT, a major step. Using it against a civilian infrastructure target would be a
Page 126
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
violation of international law. Nations that signed the CWLT might put in place good internal
controls to prevent their own cyber warriors from starting something without proper
authorization.
5. CYBERSPACE AT MIDDLE AGE
The fifth element of fighting cyber war is research on more secure network designs. The Internet
is now forty, entering midlife, yet it has not changed much from its early days. Yes, bandwidth
certainly has grown, as has wireless connectivity, and mobile devices have proliferated. But the
underlying design of the Internet, which was done without any serious thought to security, is
unaltered. Although many software glitches and security issues were supposed to have
disappeared when Microsoft replaced its earlier buggy operating systems with Vista and now
Windows 7, problems persist with all of the most ubiquitous software programs.
When I asked the head of network security for AT&T what he would do if someone made
him Cyber Czar for a day, he didnâ t hesitate. â  Software.â Ed Amoroso sees more security issues
in a day than most computer security specialists see in a year. He has written four books on the
subject and teaches an engineering course on cyber security. â  Software is most of the problem.
We have to find a way to write software which has many fewer errors and which is more secure.
Thatâ s where the government should be funding R&D.â Hackers get in where they donâ t belong,
most often because they have obtained â  root,â or administrator status, through a glitch they have
discovered in the software. There are two research priorities created by that phenomenon. We
have to do a better job of finding the errors and vulnerabilities in existing software, which is a
matter of testing in various ways. But at the same time we need to find a process for writing new
applications and operating systems from scratch with close to zero defects.
As much as people fear robots and artificial intelligence (without knowing that there are
already a lot of both at work today), it may be worth thinking about using artificial intelligence to
write new code. It would mean coming up with a set of rules for writing secure and elegant code.
The rules would have to be extensive and iterated with testing. The project would be sufficiently
large that it would require government research funding, but it should be possible gradually to
develop an artificial intelligence program that could respond to requests to write software. The
artificial code writer could compete with famous software designers, much as IBMâ s Big Blue
played against human chess masters. Drawing on the open source movement, it could be possible
to get the worldâ s experts to contribute to the process.
The work that was done to create the Internet forty years ago has been enormously valuable,
far more so than the inventors ever thought then that it would be. Now the funders of the original
Internet should fund an attempt to do something better. Today cyber research is fragmented and,
according to a presidential advisory board, cyber security research is dangerously underfunded.
Cyberspace also needs a fresh look from designers who are freed to think of new protocols, new
ways of authenticating, and advanced approaches for authorizing access, seamlessly encrypting
both traffic and data at rest.
There are some signs of renewed life at DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency), which funded much of the early Internet development. After years of abandoning
research on the public Internet, things have begun to change. In October 2009, DARPA granted
a contract to a consortium including defense contractor Lockheed and router manufacturer
Juniper Networks to design a new basic protocol for the Internet. For decades, the Internet has
been breaking traffic up into little digital packets, each with its own address space, or â  header.â
The header has the basic to and from information. The protocol or format for these packets is
named TCP/IP (Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). For the gods and founders of the
Internet, TCP/IP is as sacred as the Ten Commandments are to some religious groups. What
DARPA is now looking for is something to replace TCP/IP. Shock and horror! The new Military
Protocol would allow for authentication of who sent every packet. It would permit prioritization
of the packets, depending upon the purpose of the communication. It might even encrypt the
Page 127
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
content. The Military Protocol would be used initially on the Pentagonâ s networks, but just think
what it could do for the Internet. It could stop most cyber crime, cyber espionage, and much of
cyber war. DARPA has no estimated ready date for the Military Protocol, nor any idea about
how the conversion process from TCP/IP would occur. Nonetheless, it is just that kind of
thinking that could make the Internet secure someday.
We should not throw out what we have until we are sure that the alternative really is better and
that the conversion process is feasible. What might that something new look like? In addition to
the Internet, cyberspace might consist of many more intranets, but these would be highly
heterogeneous, running one of several different protocols. Some of the intranets might have â  thin
clients,â which are not skinny guys looking for a lawyer, but computer terminals that use
well-controlled servers or mainframes rather than having an extensive hard drive on every desk.
Centralized mainframes (yes, the old mainframe) that, if they failed, would be backed up by
redundant hardware at other locations, could manage intranets to prevent security violations and
configuration mismanagement at the nodes. The intranetsâ  traffic would run on separate fibers
from the public Internet and could be switched by routers that did not touch the public Internet.
Data could be scanned for malware and backed up in redundant data farms, some of which
would always be disconnected from the network in case of a corrupting system failure. All of
these new intranets could use constant scanning technologies to detect and prevent anomalous
activity, intrusions, identity theft, malicious software, or unauthorized exporting of data. The
intranets could encrypt all data and require that a user prove with two or three reliable methods
who he is before he could access the intranet. If the new nets were â  packet switched,â as the
Internet is now, the userâ s authenticated identity could be embedded in each packet. Most
important, these networks could constantly monitor for and prevent connectivity to the Internet.
A lot of people will hate that idea. Many of the Internetâ s earliest advocates strongly believe
that information should be free and freely disseminated, and that essential to that freedom is the
right to access information anonymously. The â  open Internetâ people believe that if you wish to
read The Communist Manifesto, or research treatments for venereal disease, or document
Chinaâ s human rights violations, or watch porn online, your access to that information will not be
free if anyone knows that you are looking at it.
But does that mean that everything should be done on one big, anonymous, open-to-everyone
network? Thatâ s how Vint Cerf and others see the Internet, and theyâ ll be damned if theyâ re
gonna agree to change it. When I worked in the White House, I proposed something I called
â  Govnet,â a private network for the internal working of federal agencies that would deny access
to those who could not really prove who they were (maybe with a special fob). Vint Cerf thought
that was an awful idea, one that would erode the open Internet, beginning a trend of cutting it up
into lots of little networks. Privacy advocates, whose cause I usually support, hated Govnet, too.
They thought it would force everyone accessing the public web pages of government agencies to
identify themselves. Of course, the public web pages would not have been on Govnet. They
would still have been on the public Internet. But in the face of opposition like that, Govnet did not
happen. It is probably time that we revisit the Govnet concept now.
In addition to Govnet for critical functions of the federal government, where else might we
want such secure networks? For airline operations and air traffic control, railroad operations,
medical centers, certain research activities, operations of financial institutions, controlling space
flight, and, of course (say it with me), for the power grid. All of these institutions would still need
an Internet-facing presence off the intranet, to communicate outside the closed community of the
intranet. But there would be no real-time connection between the secure networks and the
Internet. Indeed, ideally the protocol, applications, and operating systems would be incompatible.
There would still be a public Internet, of course, and we would all still use it for entertainment,
information, buying things, sending e-mail, fighting for human rights, learning about medical
problems, looking at pornography, and engaging in cyber crime. But if we worked at a bank, the
IRS, or the train company, or (say it loudly) the electric company, we would use one of these
Page 128
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
new secure, special-purpose intranets when we were at work. Cyber war could still target these
intranets, but their diversity, their use of separate routers and fiber, and their highly secured
internals would make it very unlikely that they could all be taken down. Vint Cerf and those
devoted to one big everybody-goes-everywhere, interconnected web wonâ t like it, but change
must come.
6. â  ITâ S POTUSâ
Those were the words our hypothetical White House official heard in chapter 2. Most of the
time, those are words you never want to hear, at least when somebody is shoving a phone in
your direction in a crisis. The sixth element of our agenda is, however, Presidential involvement. I
know that everyone working on a policy issue thinks the President should spend a day a week on
his or her pet rock. I donâ t.
The President should, however, be required to approve personally the emplacement of logic
bombs in other nationsâ  networks, as well as approve the creation of trapdoors on a class of
politically sensitive targets. Because logic bombs are a demonstration of hostile intent, the
President alone should be the one who decides that he or she wants to run the destabilizing risks
associated with their placement. The President should be the one to judge the likelihood of the
U.S. being in armed conflict with another nation in the foreseeable future, and only if that
possibility is high should he or she authorize logic bombs. Key congressional leaders should be
informed of such presidential decisions, just as they are for other covert actions. Then, on an
annual basis, the President should review the status of all major cyber espionage, cyber war
preparation of the battlefield, and cyber defense programs. An annual cyber defense report to the
President should spell out the progress made on defending the backbone, securing the DoD
networks, and (let me hear you say it) protecting the electric power grid.
In this annual checkup, the President should review what Cyber Command has done: what
networks they have penetrated, what options would be available to him in a crisis, and whether
there are any modifications needed to his earlier guidance. This review would be similar to the
annual covert-action review and the periodic dusting off of the nuclear war plan with the
President. Knowing that there is an annual checkup keeps everybody honest. While he is
reviewing the cyber war strategy implementation, the President could annually get a report from
our proposed Cyber Defense Administration on its progress in securing government agencies, the
Tier 1 ISPs, and (all together now) the power grid.
Finally, the President should put reducing Chinese cyber espionage at the top of the diplomatic
agenda, and make clear that such behavior amounts to a form of economic warfare.
As I suggested earlier, the President should use the occasion of his annual commencement
address at a military service academy, looking out over the cadets or midshipmen and their proud
families, to promulgate the Obama Doctrine of Cyber Equivalence, whereby a cyber attack on us
will be treated the same as if it were a kinetic attack and that we will respond in the manner we
think best, based upon the nature and extent of the provocation. I suggested that he add a
proposal for a global system of National Cyber Accountability that would impose on nations the
responsibility to deal with cyber criminals and allegedly spontaneous civilian hacktivists, and an
Obligation to Assist in stopping and investigating cyber attacks. It would be a sharp contrast to
the Bush Doctrine, announced at West Point, that expressed the sentiment that we should feel
free to bomb or invade any nation that scares us, even before it does anything to us.
To follow up such a spring speech at an academy, the President should then in September give
his annual address at the opening of the United Nations General Assembly session. Looking out
from that green granite podium at the leaders or representatives of nine-score countries, he
should say that
The cyber network technology that my nation has given to the world has become a great force
for good, advancing global commerce, sharing medical knowledge that has saved millions of
lives, exposing human rights violations, shrinking the globe, and, through DNA research,
Page 129
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
making us more aware that we are all descendants of the same African Eve.
But cyberspace has also been abused, as a playground for criminals, a place where billions
of dollars are annually siphoned off to support cartelsâ  illicit activities. And it has already been
used by some as a battlespace. Because cyber weapons are so easily activated and the
identity of an attacker can sometimes be kept secret, because cyber weapons can strike
thousands of targets and inflict extensive disruption and damage in seconds, they are
potentially a new source of instability in a crisis, and could become a new threat to peace.
Make no mistake about it, my nation will defend itself and its allies in cyberspace as
elsewhere. We will consider an attack upon us through cyberspace as equivalent to any
other attack and will respond in a manner we believe appropriate based on the provocation.
But we are willing, as well, to pledge in a treaty that we will not be the first in a conflict to
use cyber weapons to attack civilian targets. We would pledge that and more, to aid in the
creation of a new international Cyber Risk Reduction Center, and undertake obligations to
assist other nations being victimized by attacks originating in cyberspace.
Cyber weapons are not, as some have claimed, simply the next stage in the evolution
of making war less lethal. If they are not properly controlled, they may result in small
disagreements spiraling out of control and leading to wider war. And our goal as signers
of the United Nations Charter is, as pledged in San Francisco well over half a century
ago, â  to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.â I ask you to join me in
taking a step back from the edge of what could be a new battlespace, and take steps not
to fight in cyberspace, but to fight against cyber war.
It could be a beautiful speech, and it could make us safer.

Glossary
A Guide to the Cyber Warriorâ s Acronyms and Phrases
Authentication: Procedures that attempt to verify that a network user is who he or she claims to be. A
simple authentication procedure is a password, but software can be used to discover passwords.
â  Two-factorâ authentication is the use of a password and something else, such as a fingerprint or a series
of digits generated by a fob, a small handheld device.
Backbone: The Internet backbone consists in the coast-to-coast trunk cables of fiber optics, referred to
as â  big pipes,â run by the Tier 1 ISPs.
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): The software system by which an ISP informs other ISPs who its
clients are so that messages intended for the client can be routed or switched to the appropriate ISP.
Sometimes an ISP may have other ISPs as clients. Thus, for example, AT&T may list on its BGP table
an Australian ISP. If a packet originates on, for example, Verizon, and Verizon does not connect to the
Australian network, a Verizon router at a telecom hotel (see below) would look at a BGP table to see
who does have such a connection and would, in this example, route the packet to AT&T for onward
routing to the Australian network. BGP tables are not highly secure and can be spoofed, leading to the
misrouting of data.
Botnet: A network of computers that have been forced to operate on the commands of an unauthorized
remote user, usually without the knowledge of their owners or operators. This network of â  robotâ
computers is then used to commit attacks on other systems. A botnet usually has one or more controller
computers, which are being directly employed by the operator behind the botnet to give orders to the
secretly controlled devices. The computers on botnets are frequently referred to as â  zombies.â Botnets
are used, among other purposes, to conduct floods of messages (see DDOS).
Buffer Overflow: A frequent error in computer code writing that allows for unauthorized user access to
a network. The error is a failure to limit the number of characters that can be entered by a non-trusted
user, thus allowing such a user to enter instructions to the software system. For example, a visitor to a
webpage may go to a section of the page where he should only be able to enter his address and instead
enters instructions that allow him to gain the same access as the networkâ s administrator.
Civilian Infrastructure: Those national systems that make it possible for the nationâ s economy to
operate, such as electric power, pipelines, railroads, aviation, telephony, and banking. In the U.S., these
separate verticals usually consist of nongovernmental entities, privately held or publicly traded
corporations that own and/or operate the systems.
Crisis Instability: In a period of rising tensions or hostilities between nations, there may be
preconditions or actions taken by one side that cause the other nation to believe it is in its best interest to
take further aggressive action. Crisis instability is that condition that may lead to decisions to escalate
military actions.
Cyber Boundary: The cyber/kinetic boundary is the decision point when a commander must decide
whether and how to move from a purely cyber war to one involving conventional forces, or kinetic
weapons. Crossing the boundary is an escalatory step that may lead to the war spiraling out of control.
DARPA (also seen as ARPA): The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is a component of
Page 131
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
the U.S. Defense Department charged with funding innovative research to meet the needs of the U.S.
military. DARPA funded the initial research that created the Internet. In 1969 ARPANET became the
first packet-switched network connecting four universities.
Deep-Packet Inspection: A procedure that scans the packets of data that make up an e-mail,
webpage, or other Internet traffic. Normally only the â  headerâ of a packet is scanned, the top part that
gives the to and from information. A deep inspection would scan the digital pattern in the content but
would not convert that content into text. The inspection looks only for digital patterns that are identical or
highly similar to known malware or hacking tools.
Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS): A basic cyber war technique often used by criminals and
other nonstate actors in which an Internet site, a server, or a router is flooded with more requests for data
than the site can respond to or process. The result of such a flood is that legitimate traffic cannot access
the site and the site is in effect shut down. Botnets are used to conduct such attacks, thus â  distributingâ
the attack over thousands of originating computers acting in unison.
Domain Name System (DNS): A hierarchy of computers that converts words used as Internet
addresses (as in www.google.com) into the numerical addresses that the networks actually use for
routing message traffic (as in 192.60.521.7294). At the lowest rung of the hierarchy a DNS server may
know only the routing information within a company; at a higher level a computer might know routing
information for within a â  domain,â such as the dot-net (.net) set of addresses. The highest-level DNS
computers may contain the routing information for a national domain, such as dot-de (.de) for Germany
â the â  deâ standing, of course, for â  Deutschland.â DNS computers are vulnerable to floods of demands
(see DDOS) and to unauthorized changes in routing information, or â  spoofing,â in which a user is sent to
a fraudulent look-alike version of the intended webpage.
Edge: That place on the Internet where local traffic connects to a larger, nationally connected fiber-optic
cable. An edge router directs locally originating traffic onto the national network.
Encryption: The scrambling of information so that it is unreadable to those who do not have the code to
unscramble it. Encrypting traffic (or â  data at restâ) prevents those who intercept it or steal it from being
able to read it.
Equivalence: The Cyber Equivalence Doctrine is a policy under which a cyber war attack will be
treated like any other attack, including a kinetic strike, and will be responded to in a manner of the
attacked nationâ s own choosing, based upon the extent of the damage done and other relevant factors.
Escalation Dominance: When one party to a conflict responds to an attack or provocation by
significantly expanding the scope or level of the conflict and at the same time communicates that if its
demands (such as war termination) are not met it can and will go even further, this is referred to as
â  escalation dominance.â The expansion of the hostilities is meant to demonstrate seriousness of intent and
strength of capability, as well as a refusal to tolerate a prolonged low-level conflict. It is similar to the
poker move of significantly raising the stakes and bringing the contest to an end-game phase in the hopes
of convincing an opponent to back down.
Espionage: Intelligence activities designed to collect information, access to which another nation (or
other actor) is attempting to deny. Cyber espionage is the unauthorized entry by a nation-state onto the
networks, computers, or databases of another nation for purposes of copying and exfiltrating sensitive
information.
Hacker: Originally, a skilled user of software or hardware who can adapt systems to do things other
Page 132
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
than their intended or original use. In common parlance, however, the term has been used to denote
someone who uses skills to gain access to a computer or network without authorization. As a verb, â  to
hackâ means to break into a system.
Internet: The global interconnected network of networks intended for general access for the
transmission of e-mails, the sharing of information on webpages, and so on. Networks may use the same
software and transmission protocols, but not be part of the Internet if they are designed to be closed off
from the global interconnected system. Such closed networks are referred to as â  intranets.â Often there
are controlled connections between intranets and the Internet. Sometimes there are unintentional
connections.
Internet Service Provider (ISP): A corporation (or government agency) that provides the wired or
wireless connectivity from a userâ s home, office, or mobile computer to the Internet. In the U.S. there are
numerous small, regional ISPs and a handful of national ISPs. Often ISPs are also telephone companies
or cable television providers.
JWICS: The Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System is the Defense Departmentâ s global
intranet for transmitting data that it has classified Top Secret/SCI (Specially Compartmented
Information). TS/SCI information is derived from intelligence collection systems such as satellites (see
NIPRNET and SIPRNET).
Latency: The extent to which a data packet is slowed from moving as quickly as possible on a network
or path. Latency is measured in seconds or parts of seconds. The fastest, unimpeded speed is referred to
as â  line rate.â The size of a fiber-optic cable and the processing speed of routers along a network
determine the line rate for that cable and/or router.
Launch on Warning: A strategy component that dictates that a nation will initiate conflictâ in this case,
a cyber warâ when intelligence indicators suggest that an opponent has or is about to commence hostile
activities.
Logic Bomb: A software application or series of instructions that cause a system or network to shut
down and/or to erase all data or software on the network.
Malware: Malicious software that causes computers or networks to do things that their owners or users
would not want done. Examples of malware include logic bombs, worms, viruses, packet sniffers, and
keystroke loggers.
National Accountability: The concept that a national government will be held responsible for cyber
attacks originating inside its physical boundaries. Also called the Arsonist in the Basement Theory (â  If
you are harboring an arsonist in your house and he is going out from your house and burning down
others, you are just as responsible as he isâ).
National Cyber Strength: A net assessment of a nationâ s ability to fight cyber war, the national cyber
strength takes into account three factors: offensive cyber capability, the nationâ s dependence upon cyber
networks, and the ability of the nation to control and defend its cyberspace through such measures as
cutting off traffic from outside the country.
NIPRNET: Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network is the Defense Departmentâ s global
intranet for information that is not classified. NIPRNET connects with the Internet at a limited number of
portals. These are two other Defense Department intranets, SIPRNET and JWICS.
Page 133
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
No First Use: In arms control, the concept that a nation will not employ a certain kind of weaponry until
and unless it has been used on it. Implicit in the concept is that a nation will only use a certain kind of
weapon on those that have already used it, and that the use of the weapon would be an in-kind
retaliation.
NSA: The National Security Agency is a U.S. intelligence agency that is also a component of the
Defense Department. NSA is the lead U.S. agency for collecting information through electronic means. It
is headquartered at Fort Meade, Maryland, and is frequently referred to simply as â  The Fort.â
Obligation to Assist: The proposal that each nation in a cyber war agreement would take on a
requirement to help other nations and/or the appropriate international body in investigating and stopping
cyber attacks originating from within its own physical boundaries.
Out of Band: Communications, frequently about the management of a network, that use a different
channel or method of communicating than the network being managed.
Server: A computer usually accessed by many others, in order to interact with information stored on it,
such as web pages or e-mails. Typically, servers are meant to operate without constant human
monitoring. Routers, which direct the movement of Internet traffic, are a type of server.
SIPRNET: Secret Internet Protocol Router Network is the Defense Departmentâ s global intranet for
transmitting confidential and secret-level information. The Defense Department classifies information into
five catergories: unclassified, confidential, secret, top secret, top secret/SCI (specially compartmented
information). The SIPRNET is supposed to be air-gapped from, i.e., not physically touching, the
unclassified NIPRNET and the Internet.
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA): Software for networks of devices
that control the operation of a system of machines such as valves, pumps, generators, transformers, and
robotic arms. SCADA software collects information about the condition of and activities on a system.
SCADA software sends instructions to devices, often to do physical movements. Instructions sent to
devices on SCADA networks are sometimes sent over the Internet or broadcast via radio waves.
Instructions are not encrypted. When the devices receive orders, they do not validate who sent the
instructions.
TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The format used to divide information such as
e-mails into digital â  packets,â each with its own to and from data so that the packet can be routed on the
Internet.
Telecom Hotels: Buildings that house large numbers of network routers, often places where major
networks connect to each other. Internet and other cyber traffic, including voice telephony, are switched
in such a facility. Large telecom hotels are sometimes called gigapops (points of presence). Early Internet
switching centers were called Metropolitan Area Exchanges (MAEs); two examples are MAE East in
Tysons Corner, Virginia, and MAE West in San Jose, California.
Tier 1: The five Internet service providers (ISPs) in the U.S. that own and operate the large, national
network of fiber-optic cables on which Internet and other cyberspace traffic runs to the major cities.
Smaller or regional ISPs use a Tier 1 to connect to Internet addresses that are on their own network.
Trapdoor: Unauthorized software maliciously added to a program to allow unauthorized entry into a
network or into the software program. Often after an initial entry, a cyber criminal or cyber warrior
leaves behind a trapdoor to permit future access to be faster and easier. Also referred to as a Trojan, or
Page 134
ABC Amber ePub Converter Trial version, http://www.processtext.com/abcepub.html
Trojan horse, after a ruse supposedly employed by Bronze Age Greek warriors to leave behind at Troy
a commando team hidden inside a statue of a horse.
