'Cause the last thing I want to do is

And he feels trapped when he's not inebriated
And it put my cares to rest
At least let me clean my room
At least let me clean my room
At least let me clean my room
At least let me clean my room (clean my room)
Blankets over mirrors, she tends to like it
But of what she might see behind it
Fair to say he's fairly sedated most days of the week
Flat on his back but he still heard the directive
Haunted by a couple big mistakes
He collected many things but never quite enough
He might have made it if he lived on a different street
He says he likes an open schedule but he mostly hates it
I don't want to go like this
I don't want to go like this
I don't want to go like this
I don't want to go like this (go like this)
I don't want to leave like this
I don't want to leave like this
I don't want to leave like this
I don't want to leave like this (leave like this)

If you're running to his room, take a breath before you break-in
Just not the traditional way
Like an isolated track

Make my people make decisions
Make my people make decisions

She had plans to change her name
She's not afraid of her reflection
Should they keep it on display
Should they keep it on display
Should they keep it on display
Should they keep it on display (on display)
So she ripped them off the mirror, stepped back and she said
Something told him he should look around and tidy up
Taking inventory of his life
Then one night she got cold with no blankets on her bed
There was a wonderful structure to the city
Tried looking at it from a new perspective
With the bells and the whistles scaled back
Wondering what to do, oh
Wondering what to do, oh
Wondering what to do, oh
Wondering what to do, oh
